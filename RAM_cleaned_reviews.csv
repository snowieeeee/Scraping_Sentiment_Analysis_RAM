Onboard the crew was friendly and a boxed snack and soft drinks were served. The seat was fine for a 2-hour flight.

They’re here to please you at any time and you don’t have to wait if you have a request. I flew a 787 and it’s was clean and in a pristine condition. Plenty leg room.

3,"Not Verified|  This is, without doubt, the worst airline I have ever flown on. They changed my initial flight at least 4 times, then cancelled it the day before the trip and the new flight was delayed. This meant we missed our connection to New York. No explanation given. We missed our first day in New York and our family who were waiting there for us. They put us up overnight in a Hotel which felt like a detention centre.

Arrived at Roberts international to find all six pieces of checked baggage were lost it turns out that as far as I could see nobody on the flight received their luggage as all the luggage put out for collection had tags from previous flights. Royal air Maroc staff at the airport were overwhelmed and unable to control 100+ angry travelers. We left the airport on local advice as tempers were being lost and things were starting to look ugly and unsafe. Attended the Royal air Maroc offices in Monrovia several times but staff were rude and unhelpful, on Saturday the 30th December we made a final attempt to collect our luggage only to find the Liberian national guard wearing riot gear were protecting the Sinkor office from angry customers, honestly you could not make this up if you tried.

6,"✅Trip Verified|  Good experience on these flights which were pretty much on time. Business Class service was not outstanding but OK. Since Royal Air Maroc is already good in Economy Class, I question the added value to this flight in Business Class with the slightly better food and the still outdated seating comfort without any added value as charging facilities for your devices or an online access for messages as it would be state of the art. A curiosity on its own is the baggage handling at the hub of Casablanca. All my three checked suitcases did not arrive on time, two with three and one with six days delay. Watch the picture. It looked like that at every gate and all around the terminal. At the end, it is like a mystery that all suitcases arrived well",1/10,good experience flights pretty much time business class service outstanding ok since royal air maroc already good economy class question added value flight business class slightly better food still outdated seating comfort without added value charging facilities devices online access messages would state art curiosity baggage handling hub casablanca three checked suitcases arrive time two three one six days delay watch picture looked like every gate around terminal end like mystery suitcases arrived well

Service was very good on the entire two flights, both time a hot and very tasty meal was served including free beverages, as soft drinks, wines and the famous Moroccan mint tea. Funny was the inflight online access to a very old presentation of RAM from times before they joined the One World alliance as well as with COVID-19 - measures. Both flights were punctual as well.

17,"Not Verified| Dear Royal Air Maroc, I am writing to formally complain about the extremely high ticket change fees, terrible flight service, and overall awful experience my partner and I encountered regarding relocating after the major earthquake in Morocco. We have previously asked for a refund by following the directions on your website; thus far, no one from Royal Air Maroc has not responded to our requests. As you know, on Friday, September 8th, at 11:11 pm local time, a massive 6.8 earthquake struck Marrakech, where we were vacationing. This powerful quake caused extensive damage across the region. For safety reasons, we had to relocate from Marrakech to Casablanca on Sunday, September 10th, to catch an earlier flight home. We were initially scheduled to fly Royal Air Maroc from Marrakech to New York on September 14th, flight number AT0202. Due to the earthquake, I contacted your team to change our flight to depart Casablanca on September 10th instead. While I appreciate accommodating this change, I was utterly shocked to be charged an exorbitant $2,321.09 change fee. Given that this unforeseen natural disaster forced us to alter plans, such excessive fees seem highly unethical. I request an immediate refund of the full $2,321.09. Customers should not pay penalties for ensuring safety after a devastating earthquake. Adding to our misery, the service on flight AT0202 on September 10th from Casablanca to New York was abysmal. The plane's bathroom sink was clogged, we could not wash our hands, and the bathroom floor was filthy wet, and slippery. The staff were completely absent and unhelpful, ignoring passenger requests. In summary, between the egregious fees and terrible flight service, this was an awful travel experience. I hope Royal Air Marco will refund the $2,321.09 in change fees and address the cleanliness and service issues on AT0202.",1/10,dear royal air maroc writing formally complain extremely high ticket change fees terrible flight service overall awful experience partner encountered regarding relocating major earthquake morocco previously asked refund following directions website thus far one royal air maroc responded requests know friday september th pm local time massive earthquake struck marrakech vacationing powerful quake caused extensive damage across region safety reasons relocate marrakech casablanca sunday september th catch earlier flight home initially scheduled fly royal air maroc marrakech new york september th flight number due earthquake contacted team change flight depart casablanca september th instead appreciate accommodating change utterly shocked charged exorbitant change fee given unforeseen natural disaster forced us alter plans excessive fees seem highly unethical request immediate refund full customers pay penalties ensuring safety devastating earthquake adding misery service flight september th casablanca new york abysmal planes bathroom sink clogged could wash hands bathroom floor filthy wet slippery staff completely absent unhelpful ignoring passenger requests summary egregious fees terrible flight service awful travel experience hope royal air marco refund change fees address cleanliness service issues

22,"✅Trip Verified| I will never use this airline again - the aircraft that they fly to most of their African destinations are fantastically old, filthy and their cabins are terribly maintained. They have a quick turnaround when they arrive at the airport - which means they are punctual. However, experience of my last flight made me realise that they aren't cleaned properly after the passengers have embarked off. So the seats have disgusting left overs, the floor has empty bottles of waters and cans of beer, which makes the already old aircraft so unappealing to sit in. As for the pilots - I am not sure how they are trained. I am a pilot myself, so I can tell when the landing is so so bumpy - when it shouldn't be - since they are coming in at a higher speed than they should be. This leads to an outrageous breaking that makes the whole landing experience so traumatic. The captain who did OK to make us arrive 16.30 on 24th June 2023, was simply awful at the landing. He broke so so hard and inconsistently making passengers unnecessarily uncomfortable, worried and traumatised.

32,"✅Trip Verified|  Madrid to Casablanca on 15th February 2023. I booked my flight online via a travel agency several months before travel and it was reassuring to have received a number of superbly informative emails from Royal Air Maroc before the flight. The airline enabled online check-in and this attention to detailed was mirrored elsewhere in the service provided. My one and only gripe was the abrupt woman on the check-in desk. She made no effort to even speak to me and roughly removed the protective cover to my passport and literally threw it under the counter at me. When I objected she turned her head and entered into a conversation with her uniformed colleagues. This rudeness is not acceptable and was entirely unnecessary too. the boarding process was well managed and the crew were well turned out and very professional. The interior of the 737-Max was tastefully decorated in a corporate and culturally reflective manner. Royal Air Maroc provided a nicely presented lunch box. The box itself was a work of art. It contained a small cake, sandwich and water and other items I do not recall. A route map was displayed and the cabin crew made themselves present. The lavatory was spotlessly clean. Although a relatively short flight the crew were a superb representation of their company and country. Landing and disembarkation were professionally handled and based on this experience, I would certainly use again. Royal Air Maroc put certain European airlines to shame.

34,"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline experience I have had in a long time. No orderly boarding in Montreal or Casablanca, no use of the zones on the boarding passes, no clear announcements, no communication when flight delayed. So people formed their own line, a mile long, and stood there for an hour waiting. No guidance whatsoever from boarding crew. The cabin was spartan - no seatback entertainment. In fact, they didn't even use their own aircraft on the transatlantic flight, but a budget Spanish aircraft. The free hotel in Casablanca was a bad joke. The flight arrived late in the first place; we waited in the airport for hours to get transported all the way into the city (another hour). There were about 75 of us, all herded like cattle, all made to wait at each step of the way for all the other passengers to be processed. Upon arrival at the hotel, we waited another hour in the lobby while they processed us one by one. By the time we reached our room, it was 6 hours after the original landing time. On the return flight, boarding in Casablanca, it was raining heavily in Casablanca. Nevertheless, they herded us onto buses, then opened the bus doors in the pouring rain with no provision for cover.

The gate staff were rather bureaucratic and unfriendly and I saw one staff member walk away from an elderly woman who needed and asked for assistance. Boarding was fairly orderly and one gained the impression of a very clean and nicely set out interior reflecting Moroccan designs and culture. The crew were a little cold but very correct in terms of their service. It was great to see a proper breakfast served to the passengers. My concern was that a clearly very sick woman was allowed to board the flight. She hardly stopped coughing for the entire duration of the flight and did not use a face mask at all. The captain did not give much information and announcements were made only in Arabic and French.

The airline made sure I was made aware of a slight change to the check-in time and to a change of aircraft. This was a very early departure to connect with an international flight in Casablanca. The interior of the aircraft was tasteful and the crew were very well presented. Safety was taken seriously and the crew were pleasant and very professional. I was impressed with the service and the comfortable Boeing 737 used on this occasion. As this was a very short and incredibly early morning departure there was no food or drinks served alas.

They indicated that they never received the payment and hence never issued the ticket. I checked my bank account and indeed it seems the payment did not go through for some reason. Now what makes me insane is: - WHY does the company send emails to confirm the flight if there is an issue in the payment? - WHY no one at RAM notified me that there was a payment issue? A simple automated email would have sufficed - WHY the service agent was so rude in handling my request. Clearly he did not put himself in client shoes when asking me to pay 3 times the initial price to fix the issue and did not apologize any single time. He did not allow me to speak to his manager.

The whole plane is a Covid super spreader event. Seats so small you couldn't stand up unless someone else did on either side of you. If the person in front of you leans back in their chair, your tray essentially collapses so you better not be eating at the time. Sound does not work on the entertainment system. No alcohol served, obviously. Terrible food. Rude/confused staff that throw things at you, like broken headphones, when you're sleeping. Limited ability for the crew to communicate in Spanish, English or French. The layover in Casablanca was supposed to be 50 minutes but was more like 15 so crazy running through the gates and then 3 rounds of security (the security being a teenager lazily unzipping your bag).

Food options there were overpriced and very poor quality. The domestic leg of my return flight was cancelled, adding an overnight stop in Casablanca. They ignored my emails and I had to call at 5am and hold for 30m to finally get through - the rest of the time they just hung up the phone and sent messages saying that they were busy. They agreed to change my ticket to a same-day connection on Turkish Airlines, which was 100 times better. The only thing I liked about RAM was the food, which was actually very tasty (delicious chicken or fish).

59,"Not Verified|  As a frequent traveler, it should be disappointing to any travel related business to hear they are by far a customers worst experience. It's been nearly 1 year while I wait for ticket to be refunded, 1 year. Just a moment ago, I got off the phone during my once a week call to the Royal Air Maroc customer service, asking if perhaps this is the week they will do the right thing and give me my money back. Sadly, no this isn't the week. The nice lady on the phone informed me it's only been 3 months since receiving my refund claim and that due to covid, things can take a bit longer. Well, let's start with the fact that the airline never notified me of the flight cancellation, and made zero effort to communicate with me regarding the cancellation, or credit or a refund for 6 months after they cancelled the flight. Once I finally reached out via phone call and email, I waited another several months with no reply. At this point, obviously frustrated, I began calling back more frequently and was finally notified that my refund claim was filed incorrectly and I had to file it again. So now nearly 1 year later, while chatting with this nice lady on the phone, she tells me that since I've only waited 3 months since my claim was re-filed, I simply haven't waited long enough. How long is long enough? At this point, it's pretty clear that I was essentially robbed by this airline, and the most frustrating part is that every time I call asking when they will do the right thing, they just smile and keep lying more. Beyond awful service, companies like this should be pursued criminally. While I don't wish anyone to go through such experiences, one look at Royal Air Maroc online reviews and the story becomes clear. I'm not the first and won't be the last. But hopefully, through reviews such as this and those of others who've been cheated, people will eventually avoid, avoid, avoid, until Royal Air Maroc does right by its customers, or goes out of business. While I'm sure there are great staff working for this company and certain aspects of this review should probably be rated higher than a 0, I refuse to be treated this way any longer.",1/10,frequent traveler disappointing travel related business hear far customers worst experience nearly year wait ticket refunded year moment ago got phone week call royal air maroc customer service asking perhaps week right thing give money back sadly isnt week nice lady phone informed months since receiving refund claim due covid things take bit longer well lets start fact airline never notified flight cancellation made zero effort communicate regarding cancellation credit refund months cancelled flight finally reached via phone call email waited another several months reply point obviously frustrated began calling back frequently finally notified refund claim filed incorrectly file nearly year later chatting nice lady phone tells since ive waited months since claim refiled simply havent waited long enough long long enough point pretty clear essentially robbed airline frustrating part every time call asking right thing smile keep lying beyond awful service companies like pursued criminally dont wish anyone go experiences one look royal air maroc online reviews story becomes clear im first wont last hopefully reviews others whove cheated people eventually avoid avoid avoid royal air maroc right customers goes business im sure great staff working company certain aspects review probably rated higher refuse treated way longer

When I tried to submit the papers to the counter in Casablanca they told me I needed to get outside the terminal and go to a special office because they could not do it either. I could not do it because I had to take the connecting flight to Miami and there was no time. When I arrived in Miami the counter for Royal Air Maroc there told me that they could not do it and that I needed to do it online. I had to call customer service multiple times and they never return my emails. At the end, after six months of wait time, they tell me I submitted the documents to late. All of that after they were the ones who did not answer owe despite me calling multiple times to check on the status of the claim.

We pleaded with them as it wasn't our fault and were told to leave the line and find a manager which we refused to do as we had no time. We explained the situation to them and no one wanted to help. Eventually we got the go ahead and were told to run to the gate. There were several more checkpoints to go through with long cues and no help. We had to run from point to point and when asking for help were just ignored. The gate was at the far side of the airport so eventually arrived with a pocket full of cash that we couldn't spend in the duty free, dying of thirst as we couldn't stop to buy water and dripping wet through after all the running.

I was informed that there were airport strikes in Casablanca and staff were messing with the customers as a form of striking. The employees lied to me and never offered explanations for the four delayed flights. They delayed my return so much that I missed my connection and had to unexpectedly stay the night in Casablanca.

80,"✅Trip Verified|  A pretty horrible experience. At Casablanca airport, aircraft parked at a remote location necessitating a bus ride in high heat to the plane. Seats extremely uncomfortable. No matter how you sit, there is no comfort. Ringing the FA call button is futile because no one ever came. Seat belt sign was turned on for an inordinately long time due to mild turbulence which had dissipated, but the sign was kept on. My young child needed to use the bathroom and crew kept sending him back to his seat. I finally went with him and told them that either he used the washroom or peed in his pants. A male FA told me that there was turbulence. I said that at the moment there wasn't any and that my son would use the washroom quickly. He said to me, ""how do you know there's no turbulence"". I answered, ""because I'm a pilot"".  He was unnecessarily curt and rude for no reason. One kid who must have been related to a crew member was sleeping in the closet with her legs protruding into the aisle. Completely unprofessional.

First flight (RAM219) from Dulles to Casablanca was fine (I was able to purchase an upgrade to business at the counter with no problem). The second flight (RAM984) from Casablanca to Malaga was delayed. We were given very little information. “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” Followed by the same announcement 3 times. 1 hour later, we boarded a bus where we sat for 20 minutes. Got onto RAM984 – a propeller jet – which was very dirty, smelt of fumes, and had insects on the interior window. The plane sat on the runway for a long time, attempted to take off and failed, and returned to the airport. We were disembarked and waited another 2 hours for a new plane (with no information from rude staff). Flight from Casablanca to DC (RAM218): I wanted to purchase an upgrade. Was told that “we don’t have a machine.” (the woman in front of me had been overbooked and was given a free upgrade.) The gate area was very crowded. They made a boarding announcement and there was no organization (see photo). No one told passengers where to go or what zones to use. Then, we waited. We were given the same RAM-standard statement, “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” This happened 2 times. People were getting very angry. Ground staff called security who came and stood at the counter looking menacing. Boarded the plane. Stayed on the ground for more than an hour with no information from flight crew. We could see mechanics staring up at the underside of the wing, not reassuring and most of the passengers around me were fearful to fly. We finally took off 3 hours after flight time.

98,"✅Trip Verified|  Marrakech to Doha via Casablanca. Marrakech to Casablanca was fine.  All fine there, apart from having to walk across the tarmac and use steps to board. Same in Casablanca. Then the nightmare started. Separating of passengers connecting to international flights and those terminating in Casablanca was done outside the rear entry doors to the arrivals terminal. Passengers were jammed up against the side of the building standing in puddles of water waiting to have their passport and ticket examined by one of two officials who told them to go through either the international connections door or the domestic arrivals door. When another bus of disembarking passengers pulled up, there was no room for them to get off the bus and stand safely out of danger from passing airport vehicles. It was slow-moving mayhem. I’d imagine that people with tight connections missed their flights. I had a 3-hour layover, so once inside the terminal, I settled down to wait for AT216 to Doha. Luckily I checked the gate number several times as it was changed without notice or announcement shortly before boarding. Again we had to walk across the tarmac and climb stairs to board. Everything seemed fine as we taxied down the runway - then sat for about 20 minutes. Eventually an announcement was made that we were going back to the terminal, and we taxied back. A hoist/lift was wheeled out to the right-hand wing and several mechanics peered at a central flap which was elevated, and made calls on their mobile phones. So we sat for 3 hours 45 minutes! No announcements were made, no refreshments were given, nothing! Eventually I went to the galley to get some water and asked one of the male flight attendants what was happening. I was told there was a “technical services” problem, but that we should be leaving within 15 minutes. Well, that never happened. By that stage, people were getting tired and irritable. The two small children in front of me were screaming and crying. People started sleeping across three seats if they had a row to themselves. Eventually we were told to prepare for takeoff. The man behind me was still sleeping across three seats as we started taxiing down the runway, one of the flight attendants saw him, shook him awake and told him to buckle up. No safety briefing was given as we were just about to take off. As we took off, I had a clear view out the window of the wing and the flap which was still elevated.  We made up 45 minutes in the air, but I still had to run through Doha airport to make my connection to Perth. I would never fly RAM again. I felt less than confident on a 6-hour flight with them as in my opinion the technical services issue did not appear to have been rectified.

You'll never get anything more than peanuts or pretzels on a domestic flight in America, so imagine my surprise! The flight attendants were polite, friendly, and courteous. The in-flight entertainment was displayed on drop-down screens (old school Charlie Chaplin, so it was family friendly), but I wasn't going to complain about the lack of entertainment options on this short of a flight. You can also access WiFi on your phone, so there are definitely some options. The plane ride was smooth, and there were no issues with debarking and picking up my luggage.

102,"✅Trip Verified|  Montreal to Casablanca in April 2017. The flight was pretty good. I have no complains regarding that. My issue started when I was refused boarding on my way back. The reason that was given to me was that the flight was overbooked and they looked for volunteers to take the flight the next day. As a solo traveller I agreed to collaborate to help out, even though I was a losing a day of work. I was given a paper with which I would have to claim a compensation when I would be back in my town. When I began the process back at home, it seemed to go well at first. They answered e-mails and they had to reimburse me 75% of my ticket cost. Then they made me give them my bank details and then I never heard from them again. I could not reach them or the line would be cut as when you call them, you're probably redirected to Morocco itself. It is very hard to hear and understand. The representatives are not very nice or patient either. I was directed to the local office in Montreal where the only lady working there never returned my messages and she is never there. I simply gave up after having wasted quite a bit of time and effort. So, I never received the money and now I never want to fly with this company again. I am a frequent traveller and I never complain. This time, I felt I had to share my unique bad experience with an air company. I have never seen this before.",9/10,montreal casablanca april flight pretty good complains regarding issue started refused boarding way back reason given flight overbooked looked volunteers take flight next day solo traveller agreed collaborate help even though losing day work given paper would claim compensation would back town began process back home seemed go well first answered emails reimburse ticket cost made give bank details never heard could reach line would cut call youre probably redirected morocco hard hear understand representatives nice patient either directed local office montreal lady working never returned messages never simply gave wasted quite bit time effort never received money never want fly company frequent traveller never complain time felt share unique bad experience air company never seen

106,"✅Trip Verified| This was my first time making use of Royal Air Maroc and I would say it was my worst experience since I started flying 20 years ago. The cabin crew staff are really nice and they try to make the most of the situation, but the ground staff at Casablanca got angry at me for asking why my connection to Monrovia was delayed by 3 hours. The flight from Luanda to Casablanca offered 2 meals which both consisted of a dry roll with a slice of processed cheese, a yogurt and a cold deformed muffin. The food to Monrovia was much better and of a much better quality. Also, the plane from Luanda was old and needed maintenance, and sitting close to the toilet with the broken door meant I could smell everything. I then had a 12 hour layover in Casablanca, but the transit hotel was full from when I landed at 10am which meant I had sit on the airport for 12 hours with no place to just relax. The flight to Monrovia was then delayed by 3 hours and staff not once told us why but rather got angry and argued with us for asking why it was delayed. Only after some passenger vowed to shutdown the airport if our flight does not leave then ground staff appeared and angrily told us to board the plane. The service of ground staff is disgusting and they treat passenger like they are a nuisance to them rather than customers. They are rude, have no patience and just could not care about making the experience comfortable for passengers.",1/10,first time making use royal air maroc would say worst experience since started flying years ago cabin crew staff really nice try make situation ground staff casablanca got angry asking connection monrovia delayed hours flight luanda casablanca offered meals consisted dry roll slice processed cheese yogurt cold deformed muffin food monrovia much better much better quality also plane luanda old needed maintenance sitting close toilet broken door meant could smell everything hour layover casablanca transit hotel full landed meant sit airport hours place relax flight monrovia delayed hours staff told us rather got angry argued us asking delayed passenger vowed shutdown airport flight leave ground staff appeared angrily told us board plane service ground staff disgusting treat passenger like nuisance rather customers rude patience could care making experience comfortable passengers

Royal Air Maroc did not properly attach my travel agency booking. When I arrived at the ticket sales counter for assistance, there was a fury of angry female agents barking at customers in three languages. They sounded like dogs whose collars were too tight. Not a drop of politeness: angry, dismissive, indifferent and incompetent - without a drop of empathy for a traveler earring on a two day journey. Only a government sponsored employee could get away with this egregious deportment. I kept quiet - dodging the continuous barrage of daggers from these angry “ladies”. My only regret was that I didn’t video these proceedings - but knew these women would make sure I never got to my destination. As a medical doctor, I am baffled at this hostility.

Many passengers wanted to have their carry-ons right above their heads no matter how crowded the plane was, so many of them were making a scene when it was full. To make matters worse, some economy passengers even put their carry-ons in the business class overhead compartments, and the crew couldn't care less when business class passengers couldn't find a spot for their own.  On the return flight from London we had to wait for an ""important"" passenger before we could pushback. Whenever I can, I fly Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar depending on where I'm going.

122,"✅Trip Verified|  Rio de Janeiro to London via Casablanca, We were supposed to fly out of Rio on Friday 20th. Once we were all checked in we went to the gate only to be told that there would be a 30 minute delay. This 30 minute delay turned into 90 minutes, with the airline finally cancelling the flight. The transportation from the airport to the hotel was a shamble.  So people like us opted just to take a cab to the suggested hotel. Once there we discover after waiting for an hour that they did not have enough rooms for everyone. So we took a second cab to the next suggested hotel. We got a room there. The following day evening was picked up by coach and we were told that our flight would be at 6pm. Again, all checked in, went to the gate and they repeated the same as the night before, cancelled our flight. Why bring everyone to the airport only to cancel their flight again. Everyone was clearly and justifiably annoyed. They had hardly any staff and no sense of direction. When asked if we would be refunded our money if we book with another airline we could not get a clear answer from them. The second nights hotel was awful, some nasty place in town.

129,"✅Trip Verified|  Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca. I must say that this airline is very nice, and I have no hesitations using it in the future. Online service is a bit weird, because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly, the system selects them for you, and there seems to be no logic behind the selection. Moscow to Casablanca (5 hours 30 minutes, on-time) Check-in was a breeze. The flight was operated by a B737-800 with a nice modern interior and mood lighting, and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats - which has tons of legroom and very comfortable old-fashioned thick seat profile. Pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat - a rare sight! The flight was half-empty, so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone. The staff were polite and quite friendly, but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service - which is awfully long for a daytime flight. The meals - full trays with salads, desserts, bread and a hot main dish - were delicious, especially the pre-ordered seafood meal, even if the presentation was a bit lacking. They also had complimentary Moroccan wine in small glass bottles, which was very classy, as well as great in taste. Surprisingly, they served one more meal around an hour before landing, which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger. This is the first time I felt so full after the economy class flight, and that's a very rare thing nowadays. The plane had no personal entertainment or power ports, so consider bringing your own. Marrakech-Casablanca (40 minutes, on-time). Check-in was very fast once again, but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats, since she apparently did not have access to the system, and I have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion. The flight on an ATR72 was almost empty, with only 11 passengers, and the ATR72 was the most comfortable plane of its category I ever took. A lot of legroom once again. This flight features zero service, not even drinks, which I found surprising - they could have at least provided water. Not a big deal, considering it's just a short hop. Casablanca airport is not a great place for transit, but not the worst one I've been to (Rome Fiumicino, I'm looking at you). Long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere, but the waiting times were actually very small. Casablanca-Moscow (5 hours 40 minutes). The flight to Moscow was operated by a similar B737-800 and was jam-packed with transit passengers from Nigeria, and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized, with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding. Once onboard, I tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change, but he told us to wait until after take-off. I asked another one, and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful, and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable. Then we switched seats with some fellow passengers, that have also been separated by the weird Royal Air Maroc seat assignment system, and ended up in the bulkhead row. The service was similar to the first flight, but this time they even provided amenity kits - with eye masks and socks, and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of Singapore Airlines, for example.

They ran my bag through x-ray without me taking out the notebook, camera, 5 small bottles of liquid and a 0.5-liter bottle of water attached to the side of my bag.

137,"✅Trip Verified|  Nice to Washington via Casablanca. Flight staff and airport not worthy of Boeing 787. Returning from 3 weeks in France we chose to fly from Nice to Casablanca and on to Washington DC on Royal Air Maroc because the second leg was on the Boeing 787. Boarding in Casablanca was confused, disorganized and perilous. As has become customary for international passengers flying to the U.S. we had a second security check at the gate where we were fully patted down and carry-on inspected. While the males were whisked through by two males, there were no female security guards. All the females had to wait nearly an hour before a female started their pat down and a similar delay until the entire line was cleared. Meanwhile the men and boys did not directly board the plane from our main terminal gate. No! We, and subsequently the women and female children had to descend three flights of dirty ill lit stairs, get on a bus and go to the old original terminal, climb three full flights of stairs to the gate and then board the plane. At check-in I had asked for my pre-ordered wheelchair as I've very limited eyesight (legally blind) and Vertigo and was told a wheelchair was not available. Stairs are a real challenge especially without my wife alongside and dependent on filthy banisters and just my cane. Our aisle seats on Boeing’s newest aircraft were comfortable, the coach class seat pitch was the usual 30” we find on most airlines. We had expected Moroccan style cuisine we experienced on an earlier trip to Morocco, but we received the same food Air Maroc served on the first leg from Nice. The cabin service was erratic and staff not at all customer-friendly. Midway through the flight we found that the rest rooms had no toilet paper, no towels, no Kleenex, and the refuse bin was overflowing. A few minutes later the captain came up the aisle going to the galley so I buttonholed him, described the conditions and stated that the cabin crew were disrespecting a new aircraft. The captain took a peek then stormed off. Shortly two male stewards rushed up with their arms loaded with paper products. They seem satisfied with their mediocrity and deficiencies and there's slim chances of improving.

We had about 2 hours delay on outward flight, while RAM on return flight decided to cancel one of its route from Canarias. We were informed of this cancellation while we were already at the airport (so 3 hours before departure) : although we bought a Las Palmas - Casablanca direct flight ticket, we had now to wait for the Tenerife plane to come to Las Palmas. I was with my family : my wife, 6 years old child and a 1 year old baby. While we were waiting our turn, the agent at check in decided to call some identified persons (that were behind us in the queue) to give them priority in registration. These people were persons in transit (their end destination was not Casablanca). After that the agent informed us that the plane was now full and that we had to wait for the day after to fly back home. I tried in vain to get someone from RAM Company to come and find solution. No one came and at the end we had to accept the situation.

142,"✅Verified Review| Flew from Agadir to Madrid via Casablance, hadn't used Royal Air Maroc before. Check in / boarding in Agadir was fine and bag was checked all they way through to Madrid - I had to book business class as I needed a fully changeable ticket, crew seemed nice enough when boarding - but that's about as much as I saw of them. I was surprised that for the fare involved on the Agadir - Casablanca sector there was not even the offer of a glass of water, the curtain to the galley was across the whole time with the smell of food wafting through (crew meals obviously) disappointing service to be honest. The transfer at Casablanca was fine / the crew on the Casablanca - Madrid sector were very pleasant, the cabin lay-out was proper ""first class"" style seating plenty of leg room, magazines offered before take-off with pre-flight water or juice. As the flight was only 1 hour and 15, I was given a meal tray which had a hot beef shawarma with fruit salad and Mango mousse cake. It was delicious to be honest and a hot towel service after. The only thing I found really odd on this sector was there were no announcements made in English at all only French and Arabic (the safety demo was a video in English and Arabic) there were a few USA passengers on board also and we had to ask the crew what the announcements were about which I found odd. On the previous sector Agadir / Casablanca all the announcements were made in French / Arabic / English so I'm unsure as to what they were up to as the majority of passengers on the Casablanca / Madrid were Spanish or English speaking.

When we tried to check in online the evening before, we could only check in from Brussels to Casablanca. No changes in flight hours where shown. When arriving in Brussels airport, 3 hours in advance, they only could check us in for the flight to Casablanca. The personel of RAM told us this was normal procedure and once we would arrive in Casablanca, we would receive our next boarding pass for the plane to Nairobi. Once arrived in Casablanca (on time, still had more than an hour to get on the other plane), the personel of RAM showed us where to obtain our other boarding passes. At this desk they suddenly told us 'that plane left more than an hour early!'. So, as our first plane was landing, the other one was already taking off! Nobody notified us, not online, no e-mail, message. We were speechless and desperate. Together with an American couple (who also booked a direct ticket from Brussels to Nairobi), the personel told us it was no problem, they would refund our flight and that we would have to take the next flight, 2 days later! This was not an option for us, because we already booked a safari with driver and airport pick up, all planned from the moment we would arrive in Nairobi. After 3 hours, they told us to come fast, because there was a flight to Cameroon we should be on. Then, from Cameroon, we would have to take a flight to Nairobi. Instead of arriving at 2am, we would arrive at 8 pm (losing an entire day of safari and hotel, but still less worse than losing 2). They told us it was safe to transfer at Douala. Once arrived in Douala (after a night flight with stopover in Yaoundé), at 4am, the border control would not let us enter (because we had no ticket and visa), they called the police, who took our pasports and we had to sleep outside the police departement at the airport! At 8am the office of Kenya Airways opened (where we had to check in for the flight). But RAM had put us 2 on wrong seats! The others could board, but not the two of us. After 2 hoffiric hours their personel managed to get us on a flight to Nairobi. Late in the evening we arrived in Nairobi, lost the money of our hotel, lost the money of our safari. The return flight from Nairobi to Paris was a disaster as well! In Nairobi, the personel told us we would have to take our luggage in Casablanca (since we were booked to spend one day at a hotel in Casablanca). In Casablance they told us they could not obtain our luggage. We had no spare clothes, toothbrush, shampoo. Next day, arriving in Paris, one of our bags was missing.

150,"✅Verified Review|  Amsterdam to Casablanca. I flew with a group of fellow travellers from Amsterdam to Bamako in Mali with a stopover in Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc told half the group to receive their boarding passes for Bamako in Casablanca. They did not, because to aircraft was severely overbooked by returning Muslims from the pilgrimage to Mecca. With trepidation, I booked Amsterdam to Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. Without any notice, Royal Air Maroc cancelled my return flight and we were booked on an earlier flight. This made me put Royal Air Maroc on 24-hour death row watch with the help of from Amadeus. Amadeus informed me that my return flight was reschedules again. 49 hours before the flight I tried to get my boarding passes, but the web check-in was still closed. Exactly 48 hours before the flight I started the web check-in to print the boarding passes, finding out that only three seats were still available on this flight. All others were already allocated to other passengers before the web check-in even opened. My wife and I could not sit together. I called Royal Air Maroc but they confirmed this was not possible to be allocated a seat before the web check-in. Sure. At the airport check-in counter, I asked to sit together. The staff member asked her colleague to release seats with an ""R"" for us. Her reply: no. At the gate, we asked it again and promptly Royal Air Maroc gave us seats next to each other. On board the 737 we noticed about 20-30 seats empty. Very strange. We asked ourselves if there is any link between the departments of reservation and operation. The flight went well and the service was good. Amadeus informed us in time that our return flight would depart 1 hour earlier, due to the temporary Ramadan time zone shift. Royal Air Maroc did sent an email message, when we were in mid-flight. The flight was on time, the service was good and the meals tasted nice.

The return journey from Casablanca to Doha was however a little different and disappointing. The aircraft was dirty and the staff inattentive. I pressed my call button a number of times; staff did not come and were sat around at the back. Because of this, I got up and went to the back of the aircraft myself where I found staff disregarded me and other customers! Eventually a young man asked me what I wanted and I requested a glass of white and red wine. He immediately dismissed me and said he would have to check at the front of the aircraft and would bring the wine to me! I waited a long time. In the end, I went back to the rear and asked again - I chose the only steward who had been polite so far throughout the journey (who was the most accommodating on the flight) he asked me what I would like.

They are consistently the keenest pricing on this route and with RAM each time you make a booking it is like rolling the dice. The experience on the European facing routes is consistently good and the aircraft modern. On the African side the experience tends to be less good but still OK. Where the element of chance comes in is that if anything goes wrong with your connection in Casablanca then these guys just melt away - like snow in the Sahara - and you will be left without information, help, or any sense that there is any coherent policy for sorting things out. I had one horrendous experience when Heathrow was fogbound and the lack of information meant that when the flight eventually too off it did so without about 20 passengers. To their credit they did eventually get us to Heathrow later the same day to be reunited with our luggage which had gone on without us.

153,"✅Verified Review|  Amsterdam to Marrakech return via Casablanca. More than 3 hours of delay on the first flight, reason given: pilot was sick, then talks about a strike (no evidence anywhere of a strike, they said this to discourage people demanding their money back).  Missed corresponding flight in Casablanca. Only 3 people to help hundreds of stranded passengers to check for other flights or solutions. One person available to help for accomodation (a basic right when stranded for the night) for hundreds of passengers. This person is then clearly stalling the whole time and telling people: ""All of the hotels nearby are full. It's not worth it to book a hotel in town if you have a flight in 7 hours, etc"". Finally we give up. We stay the night in a cold airport. Next morning: finally the connecting flight. Upon arrival we notice our luggage was not on the flight (even after checking with several different people at Casablanca airport that the luggage would come). Nobody from Royal Air Maroc at Marrakesh airport. After an hour of searching somebody could verify our luggage was still somewhere in the system. It arrived at night, we had to take a taxi and lose more time. Finally,  when checking in for the flight back home we were told that our booking for the flight got automatically cancelled because there were problems with one or more previous flights. Nobody at the airport to help us, so we had to call the helpdesk and try and explain this whole thing. Told on the phone that somebody would call back with a solution. When they finally called back after more than an hour, ensuring us that we could now get on the plane, we were told in the airport that it was too late: boarding had closed.

154,"✅Verified Review|  Marrakech to Casablanca. Poor communication and customer service. Our flight was delayed by 2.5 hours which resulted in us missing our connection on Emirates. I travel frequently and realise these things happen, though this is where Royal Air Maroc really fail in their customer service. Passengers started complaining to security staff approximately one hour after departure after no word from Royal Air Maroc. Royal Air Maroc finally sent a representative to the gate after 1.5 hrs after the flight was meant to depart to sort passengers out with connections. After 2.5 hrs we spoke to staff who informed us that we had been rebooked a flight the next day and we needed to pick up our boarding passes and accommodation voucher from the transit desk in Casablanca.  When we arrived at the transit desk where we were informed that they would deal with us shortly. This went on for more than 2 hours. Finally they advised us that we had not been booked on a flight as yet and they were working on our connection. A further 2 hours went by. Now 4 hours. No where to to buy food or get a drink. We were travelling with 3 young children aged 4 yrs to 9 yrs. We did ask staff about getting water though we were advised that we would have to clear customs buy water and then re renter though we would need a boarding pass which at as yet we did not have!  Finally they agreed to continue working on our connecting flight and organise accommodation. We passed through customs and and waited for another hour for them to organise our accommodation. We were advised that we were now booked on the flight the following day and needed to pick up boarding passes in the morning. We arrived at the hotel 6 hours after landing. At the hotel we found out that Royal Air Maroc had booked our rooms incorrectly. Luckily the staff at the front desk were helpful and were able to sort things out.

155,"✅Verified Review|  Just as a pre-emptive note, I have flown many times and to Europe over 10 times and have never had such a horrendous experience. I flew out of JFK on March 23 2017, flight AT201 with a connection in Casablanca. The crew were inattentive and unfriendly. It was mostly an all-male crew. My TV monitor’s sound did not work and after 2.5 hrs into the flight of trying to get it fixed and trying to get their attention I finally gave up. They would never answer my attendant call button. On the return home it was even worse, I flew out of Rome, connected in Casablanca and then to JFK. From Rome on April 3, 2017 I was supposed to leave at 6.20pm, but the flight I was told was delayed 15 minutes. Well almost a full 6 hours later they finally got us on a flight at 12.10 midnight to Casablanca. There was little to no communication as to why we were delayed nor what our options were nor updates. Once in Casablanca at 2.30am we were just let off the plane with no explanation as to what to do, where to go, who to talk to or nothing. We got to the customs area where they gave us tickets for our connecting flight (we missed the 1st connecting flight, which was supposed to leave 10.30pm out of Casablanca to JFK) so the next available flight was at 2.45 pm (a full 12 hrs later). RAM did not tell us we could get a hotel or even where to go to get a voucher, I stopped at an information booth and she told me where to go. I got the voucher and the shuttle bus to the hotel, which was 4.00am by that time and got to my room. On the flight back to JFK again the TV Monitor sound did not work, but I didn’t even try to get them to fix it based on the last flight. Again the flight attendants were inattentive and unfriendly. The airport was scary, they were having demonstrations outside the area you had to walk thru to go to security and your gate.  I don’t usually complain but this was such a bad experience I felt I needed to write a review.",1/10,verified review preemptive note flown many times europe times never horrendous experience flew jfk march flight connection casablanca crew inattentive unfriendly mostly allmale crew tv monitors sound work hrs flight trying get fixed trying get attention finally gave would never answer attendant call button return home even worse flew rome connected casablanca jfk rome april supposed leave pm flight told delayed minutes well almost full hours later finally got us flight midnight casablanca little communication delayed options updates casablanca let plane explanation go talk nothing got customs area gave us tickets connecting flight missed st connecting flight supposed leave pm casablanca jfk next available flight pm full hrs later ram tell us could get hotel even go get voucher stopped information booth told go got voucher shuttle bus hotel time got room flight back jfk tv monitor sound work didnt even try get fix based last flight flight attendants inattentive unfriendly airport scary demonstrations outside area walk thru go security gate dont usually complain bad experience felt needed write review
156,"✅Verified Review|  Utter Chaos! I had the misfortune of booking onto a Royal Air Maroc flight from Casablanca to Tangier at 11pm. I realised things were amiss when my coach pulled up to the plane and the lights were flickering on and off. There was an electrical fault, and the passengers were eventually sent back to the terminal. I can only assume all Royal Air Maroc staff then hid, as for the next 3 hours we were locked in the airport with no information and nobody to ask. There was a small passenger uprising, resulting in half the flight marching out of the airport. Chaos ensued and eventually at 4am a RAM representative arrived and directed passengers to a 'replacement coach'. When confronted by dozens of tired and angry looking passengers the surprised coach driver explained he was driving to Fez the next day, and we eventually established no replacement coach had been arranged. More chaos followed, followed by a 4 hour ride in a 1950s taxi eventually arriving 9:30am with no sleep. RAM promised compensation, but never paid and don't respond to e-mails.

However, the crew wakes you up when serving dinner. When stopping at 1.30 pm in Praia, they put all the lights on (OK, I can understand that, for security procedures maybe) and also the music! Why?

158,"✅Verified Review|  São Paulo to Geneva via Casablanca. Overall, I was positively surprised. Boeing 787 is an incredible airplane, and very quiet, which helps out with sleeping. Seating is spacious and there is lots of leg room and space in the overhead compartments. Check-in and boarding in Sao Paulo were comparable to any other airline and staff quite helpful. There was a line in the accommodation desk of RAM in Casablanca but it moved quickly, and I was put in a very nice hotel during my 15 hour layover, with dinner and breakfast included. My bags arrived normally in Geneva. No delays in any two flights. Problems with RAM though: the food is horrible, especially on the longer flight. Although the flavor was okay, it was very poorly presented, overall low quality, and not something you would expect at an airline. No alcoholic drinks on board, no snacks or extra beverages in between meals. Staff in the longer flight seemed impatient and not very willing to help. Bathroom was a bit dirty as well. On the shorter flight food was a bit better but still poorly presented. Staff was a lot more professional. My ticket was not cheap at all. I think overall the service of RAM was acceptable, but the food was a low point and reason enough for me not to fly with them again until I hear that has improved.",5/10,verified review paulo geneva via casablanca overall positively surprised boeing incredible airplane quiet helps sleeping seating spacious lots leg room space overhead compartments checkin boarding sao paulo comparable airline staff quite helpful line accommodation desk ram casablanca moved quickly put nice hotel hour layover dinner breakfast included bags arrived normally geneva delays two flights problems ram though food horrible especially longer flight although flavor okay poorly presented overall low quality something would expect airline alcoholic drinks board snacks extra beverages meals staff longer flight seemed impatient willing help bathroom bit dirty well shorter flight food bit better still poorly presented staff lot professional ticket cheap think overall service ram acceptable food low point reason enough fly hear improved
159,"✅Verified Review|  Frankfurt to Monrovia via Casablanca and Accra. Royal Air Maroc check in at Frankfurt Airport was efficient and painless. The flight took off a few minutes late but reached Casablanca on time. Food and beverage service on board was okay and a hot meal was served. After a 4 hour transit in a very dirty airport, the flight took off on time for Accra. Food and beverage selection was ok considering that only breakfast was served with nothing being offered on the Accra to Monrovia route. The fun started on arrival in Monrovia as one suitcase was missing. The necessary lost luggage form was filled in and submitted. After a week's interaction with RAM Monrovia office, the lost suitcase has neither been traced, found or delivered. A RAM employee confirmed that because RAM flights are very full, not all check-in luggage is loaded onto the aircraft which leads to inevitable delays and great frustration at the destination. In fact, the city office of Royal Air Maroc in Monrovia has turned into a heap of lost luggage and irate passengers have to daily go and search for their own luggage as RAM never returns any calls not appears to follow up on any enquiries. This is really shameful and my advice would be to avoid flying Royal Air Maroc at all costs.",6/10,verified review frankfurt monrovia via casablanca accra royal air maroc check frankfurt airport efficient painless flight took minutes late reached casablanca time food beverage service board okay hot meal served hour transit dirty airport flight took time accra food beverage selection ok considering breakfast served nothing offered accra monrovia route fun started arrival monrovia one suitcase missing necessary lost luggage form filled submitted weeks interaction ram monrovia office lost suitcase neither traced found delivered ram employee confirmed ram flights full checkin luggage loaded onto aircraft leads inevitable delays great frustration destination fact city office royal air maroc monrovia turned heap lost luggage irate passengers daily go search luggage ram never returns calls appears follow enquiries really shameful advice would avoid flying royal air maroc costs
160,"✅Verified Review|  Rio de Janeiro to London Gatwick via Casablanca. Had a really good experience flying to/from Brazil for the Paralympic Games on Royal Air Maroc. The Boeing 737-800's used on the legs between LGW and CMN are very clean and modern, incorporating the Boeing sky interior. Boeing 767-300's on the long haul sectors are showing their age but still very comfortable for a 9 hour journey. All aircraft had extremely generous legroom and the food on board was of a high standard, including alcoholic drinks. The cabin crews were all very professional and courteous. The only slight complaint onboard was that the IFE system on the B767's was rather temperamental and prone to resetting quite often, which made it impossible to watch movies. RAM accommodate transit passengers free of charge in a central Casablanca hotel if you have a long layover, which is fine and a nice touch, but can end up being rather fraught and stressful by the time you have travelled to/from the hotel and had to deal with the nightmare of negotiating the semi-organised chaos at CMN airport.

161,"✅Verified Review| One-way flight Tunis to Dakar via Casablanca on November 29 on Royal Air Maroc B737-800s. Check-in at Tunis airport was quick and agent gave me window seats all the way to Dakar. Plane boarded with some organization with Business class and families first, then coach class. Not too disorderly so enjoyed that. Flight attendants were great and welcoming. Took off early and 2 1/2 hour flight to Casablanca. Delicious Moroccan chicken dinner was served with 2 drink runs. No sound available so they showed Bugs Bunny cartoons on the screens with no sound - sort-of strange. Why bother showing them at all? Just show the moving map - which they didn't have either. Landed on-time and bussed to the main terminal where the transit security line was insane. Be prepared for these kind of lines in western Africa and for disorder as passengers push and shove to get to the front. Dakar flight boarded with confusion as many carry-on's were too large for the overhead bins. So we were stuck on the jet-bridge as every passengers carry-on was evaluated. On-board it was a crazy free-for-all with people just sitting anywhere they wanted. Then when the passenger assigned to that seat came they either made the person move (as I did to the guy in my seat) to just grabbing an open seat - which then made the passenger in that seat make them move or look around. It was chaos but funny - the flight attendant saw me laughing and joined in - was just crazy. Ended up with a seat next to me open which was really great! Again take-off on time and served a delicious meal. Charlie Chaplin silent film shown which was perfect as again there is no sound on the airplane. And this time they also showed the moving map which was good. Landed on-time and bused to terminal where bags came out last but was just glad to get it.

We check in for our flight, and are informed together with 15 other passengers that our luggage will be put on hold until we have customs clearance. At the customs, the officer in charge informed us that RAM has been applying a new rule for a couple of month, that they will not embark passengers without a visa on their passport, despite the fact that the visa can be obtained at arrival. They also said that we can embark if we have a clearance from the RAM lead station officer at the airport. We asked for him, but no one was able to give us either his name or to contact him. He only came after the plane took off to ask us to give him back the boarding passes (for an unkonwn reason) and then he left us there, at 1 am in the airport. A police officer at the airport told us that RAM has been consistenly refusing boarding to Moroccan citizens on this destination, despite the fact that they still communicate on the fact that visa can be obtained at arrival, even on their marketing campaigns on this destination.

The white wine was excellent. Tea and coffee also served. 2 male flight attendants worked in the economy cabin and the pace of service was good.

185,"Lisbon to Conakry via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. The aircraft was old with no entertainment and poorly maintained toilets. The upside is the hotel room being offered for long layovers. Yesterday's trip was one of the worst I have experienced. The plane from Casablanca to Conakry was fully booked and the staff was unable to handle boarding. While people were scrambling to board and to place the too many carry-ons in the limited space available, the staff was still stocking the plane, causing havoc, and there were quite aggressive verbal communication between staff and passengers unwilling to surrender their carry-ons. My assigned seat was occupied and a flight attendant asked me to accept an alternative seat, not to inconvenience the passenger who took my seat. After being offered several already taken places and a middle seat that I refused, the same flight attendant angrily told me to just take my seat and relocated the person wrongly seated.

186,"Lagos to Sao Paulo via Casablanca. We frequently fly long distance between countries and our goal is generally to find the cheapest ticket possible because we've found that flights and services can really vary. We didn't expect great but things ended up being better than our expectation. We had no issues with getting seats and people checking-in were nice. The staff was nice. Food and wine are good. I recommend you take a bottle of water each yourself, but that's a recommendation I would make for any long flight. The amazing part about RAM is that changing the flight generally costs only around 60 euros or so and they don't keep changing their prices. So, if you want a flight that's flexible, go with Royal Air Maroc. We ended up changing our flights twice! Comfort level etc. is okay on the flight, not great but you get the value for your money.

188,"My wife and I traveled Royal Air Maroc from Montreal to Barcelona via Casablanca return in September 2015. I was very pleasantly surprised. Starting with the staff at the registration desk in Montreal who managed so that my wife and I could sit together for the trip. We were greeted by a friendly, smiling staff (somewhat less in Casablanca). The aircraft (Boeing 787-8 is new) was very clean and provided a perfect entertainment service, and I, 1m 85, had plenty of space for the legs. The meal with wine (bottle and not in a plastic glass) was hot and tasty. Our flight to go was more enjoyable. As regards to the return, it is regrettable that RAM does not take into account the link between two passengers. It sells tickets and seats in alphabetical order, so that people do not sit together. In our case, on return, this gave rise to a situation where travellers already on board began to negotiate with other passengers of the changes of places to be seated together. There were people who marched in the aisles to their new seats at cross-purpose of those who where boarding with their carry-on baggage. General confusion! I sincerely hope that RAM will solve this problem.

189,"Absolute Nightmare. the Royal Air Maroc flight from JFK to Casablanca was OK. Flight from Casablanca to JFK was supposed to be at 2:55 pm Saturday. A morning check of website and email showed that flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for a flight at 12:30 am. Sunday. Shortly later received an email that it was rescheduled for 4:00 .m. No further emails and website still showed 12:30 am. Got to airport for 4:00 am. flight and found out that it had been rescheduled for 7:00 am. Luckily our tour guide was still with us and he got them to give us a hotel room for a few hours. Boarded on time but then sat in the plane for an hour waiting for every connecting flight to arrive in Casablanca. Then 20 minutes more while they found and removed the luggage of two people who did not arrive (no complaint about that - welcome safety measure). Finally left at 8:20 am. 17+ hours late. During the whole time on the ground and for the first hour or so of the flight there were 5 or 6 children screaming constantly at the top of their lungs. The parents apparently didn't feel any need to try to quiet them. The screaming combined with the nice Moroccan music played while on the ground it made it impossible to read, sleep, or listen to an audiobook. To top it off, US Customs forms were only provided in French so returning US citizens who couldn't read French had to find another passenger who could translate the form for them. In general, this airline is not up to the standards of other airlines. Boarding is just rushing to get near the front of the scrum so as not to be last to board. At JFK this got you onto the jetway but in Casablanca you then had to carry your heavy carry-on down a long flight of stairs, board a bus, and then carry the heavy carry-on up the shaky stairs to the plane (probably an airport not airline issue). JFK to Casablanca, flight attendants did nothing to ensure efficient use of overheads. No announcement about a 45 minute gate hold at JFK. Announcement in Casablanca that plane was being held for connecting passengers was not made right away. Food was skimpy. Nothing on tray to drink. Served coffee and tea after a while but water wasn't brought until after food was eaten. They didn't come around with water during flight but if you knew about it you could go back to the galley and help yourself to water. No beverage service on Casablanca to JFK flight until just before arrival after the dinner trays were given out. By the way, don't buy water at the Casablanca airport to take on the plane. They have security people at the gate go through your luggage to take it away or force you to drink the whole thing right there. There are three security checks: one to get into the airport, one to get into the passenger only gate section, and one at the gate. Don't get rid of your water until the last one. We got rid of the water that we had with us at the second security check then paid $3 for a 50 cent bottle of water to take on the plane but had to give it up or drink it up at the last security check. I had to drink the whole thing there in order to have the empty bottle.

205,Just flew from YUL to Casa on the older 747 operated by Royal Air Maroc. I was hesitant after reading reviews but alas I was pleasantly surprised. We were first to check in as we were unable to do online check-in in Montreal - no big deal if no one could then I was happy we were all in the same boat. Our agent was fantastic and have us options as the flight was basically empty but wanted to ensure my friend and I (both 6ft) would have ample leg room for the 6hr flight. Boarding was efficient and our ticketing agent was doing the boarding procedures at the gate. As we boarded the plane I was horrified to find no head rest entertainment system - but I was prepared with a charged tablet and phone. Needless to say our flight was a 2200 - I did plan to sleep a bit. Little disappointed the seats didn't recline - but again it wasn't just mine it was everyone and took comfort in knowing that those without the exit row weren't going to have their knees crushed by the person in front of them. The meal was better than any bought sandwich I've had on Air Canada would say for economy class this was above standard. The attendant told me I could take a row of seats to myself. Woke up a few hours later with an hour and a half till touch down changed my seat so I could look out of the window. A female flight attendant came by and said if I wanted breakfast I would have to go back to my original seat and then disappeared. The original steward who showed us the empty section told me he couldn't stop me from going to the back of the plane with my breakfast handed me my tray in the galley and promptly asked if I w anted coffee with a smile. Breakfast was bland pastries and juice and applesauce.

My other issue was a dingy bathroom with bar soap. The flight attendants were not what I would rank as the friendliest I have met. I am glad I did not pay the full price for this business class.

212,I had a return flight from LGW to RAK. Both the outbound and return flights were on time and boarding was nice and early so there wasn't a scramble to get everyone on board the aeroplane. On the outbound flight I was given an emergency exit seat which meant I had plenty of legroom. However even on the return flight seat pitch wasn't an issue. The food was poor. I had ordered a vegetarian meal and on the outbound flight it was inedible. The food on the return flight wasn't very good but at least was edible. Drinks were supplied and wine was also on offer. As the flight is only 3h15m I see the food as an added bonus rather than a deal breaker especially as the alternative is to with EasyJet or Ryanair who don't supply any free food or drinks. There was a video being shown during the flight but I spent the time reading so cannot really comment on the entertainment.,1/10,return flight lgw rak outbound return flights time boarding nice early wasnt scramble get everyone board aeroplane outbound flight given emergency exit seat meant plenty legroom however even return flight seat pitch wasnt issue food poor ordered vegetarian meal outbound flight inedible food return flight wasnt good least edible drinks supplied wine also offer flight hm see food added bonus rather deal breaker especially alternative easyjet ryanair dont supply free food drinks video shown flight spent time reading cannot really comment entertainment

215,Terrible customer service. Travelling in business class connecting via Casablanca because of a delayed onward flight I was forced to change flights and wait there for 24 hours. These things happen fine. A key measure of service quality is how the airline then reacts when things go wrong particularly for premium customers. I have rarely witnessed such complete disinterest. It took me six hours - from 9pm to 3am - to get the airline to rebook me find my baggage and promise me a hotel. The guy who was issuing hotel vouchers then disappeared for hours without explanation or apology leaving myself and 20 others stranded. Eventually I had to take a taxi to stay in a hotel in the city 30km away at my own expense. Upon return to the airport the next day I asked to speak to someone senior to file a complaint and request reimbursement and was waved away. I work for an organisation which flies thousands of professionals in business class with the airline each year - even when made aware of this their level of service remained pegged firmly at zero. A 48-hour nightmare.,1/10,terrible customer service travelling business class connecting via casablanca delayed onward flight forced change flights wait hours things happen fine key measure service quality airline reacts things go wrong particularly premium customers rarely witnessed complete disinterest took six hours pm get airline rebook find baggage promise hotel guy issuing hotel vouchers disappeared hours without explanation apology leaving others stranded eventually take taxi stay hotel city km away expense upon return airport next day asked speak someone senior file complaint request reimbursement waved away work organisation flies thousands professionals business class airline year even made aware level service remained pegged firmly zero hour nightmare

217,Outgoing route - London Heathrow to Casablanca (flight AT 801) Casablanca to Banjul (AT 557) 23rd July 2014 arriving 24th July. Return. Awful service. Entertainment? What entertainment? No radio inflight movie or children's entertainment packs have ever been evident on any of the RAM flights I have been on. Every flight I have taken we have ordered non-dairy vegetarian meals - but they never materialise. This last flight (yesterday) they tried to serve us a family of lifelong vegetarians chicken! The staff refused to believe that vegetarian meals had been ordered - even when I produced the tickets which clearly showed vegetarian non-dairy meals were specified for all 3 of us. Transfer times at Casablanca are woefully inadequate which has always results in our luggage getting a few days extra holiday time without me - and there is always a slight of hand which somehow negates any chance of remuneration.

218,"On Aug 24 we get to Casablanca airport at 1am for our 4am flight to find our that it was rescheduled to 8.30am. No prior notice or updates on RAM's website and airport screens still showed 4am at 6am! There was a mob of passengers whose CMN-JFK flights had been cancelled the previous two days trying to get updates from a couple of clueless RAM employees. Concerned that we would get booted off our flight I asked a RAM agent who exactly was getting on the 8.30 flight. She said it was for passengers with confirmed seats on the original 4am flight. Her supervisor later confirmed that I and the other five people in our party had no reason to worry. We sat and waited our turn to check in. When we got up to the counter at 6.30am to our surprise the check in agent said ""sorry but we only have 3 seats left!"" After some back and forth we were put on the next flight at 5pm. She said because we were the only Gold FFs on the afternoon flight and business class was half empty they would make it up to us with an upgrade. In the meantime she sent us to one of their offices to get hotel vouchers where we could stay for the next 8-9 hours until the next flight. I got up to that office and of course there was another mob and more passenger-staff arguments. I got a chance to briefly speak with one of the RAM agents there and he said there was no hotel availability near the airport and what he could offer us was a hotel downtown (45+ minutes away). We declined and stayed at the airport. When it was time to check in for the afternoon flight the agent at the counter said any ugrades would have to be done at the gate later the gate agent said there was plenty of availability in business and we were the only ones on the upgrade list but that she could not do it - it had to be done back at check in or by the crew inside the aircraft! Nonsense. We get inside the aircraft and of course the head of crew says ""we appreciate your loyalty but the upgrade had to be done by the agents."" Forget it.

222,I travel JFK - Casablanca three times a year coach. Best price and shortest flight from U.S. They are now using 767s. If you are lucky you will get an upgraded aircraft with nice seats and seatback screens. The older cabins are well worn may not have a movie seats are soiled and can have an order. Since the planes are usually full expect the toilets to be a mess after a few hours. Plane departs and arrives on time unless JFK is having problems. When boarding try to get to the head of the line. I usually don't care since everyone gets on board but many Moroccan travelers have a lot of carry on and the compartments fill up fast. No baggage fee for two bags but 50 lb limit each is enforced. Overage is costly. Food is fine and plentiful but I have lived overseas a long time and not fussy. If you are picky carry something on. Casablanca: terminal is fine. Arrival is easy. Departure check in 90 min early because delay at counter with people re-packing bags because of weight and of all the check points. Airport police and immigration officials are efficient and rarely discourteous. Go to gate area and relax. There is a restaurant. If you keep your expectations low you will be fine.

Leg room was actually quite good and I was able to stretch my legs - however I am only 5ft 3! Both flights smooth except for a dodgy landing back into Heathrow.

Eventually got to the front of the queue to be told that the flight was overbooked and they had no seat for me. I was given a boarding pass for the direct flight to London at 3pm the next day. I explained that I did not want to spend another night away from home and that I would like to transfer to any other flight to Europe. I was told there were no seats available. I was given a slip of paper to take to the cashier to claim 1500 Dirhams compensation. The cashier refused to pay offering only an upgrade to business class for my next flight. I spent some time at the ticket office trying to get another ticket to anywhere but was told that the ticket office could not issue tickets and that I had to queue up at a check in desk to ask if there was space on a flight.

A number of passengers phoned the airline to find out what was going on only to be told the flight had been cancelled. No notifications were provided to any of the passengers and the flight was rescheduled to the following day. Not even the information boards in the airport reflected that the flight was cancelled. I had to go back to my hotel and come back the following day only to find the flight times had been changed twice.

Worse to come on return - Marrakech to Casablanca flight sort of left on time but again delayed in Casablanca for 1.5 hours with no help from RAM staff other than to be coldly told to 'go sit and wait for 45 minutes. 1.5 hours later we departed.

Our seats and meal trays were filthy and we had to wipe them down with hand wipes to remove food and other material. On the return trip there was no room in the overhead lockers for our carry on luggage. Cabin crew just asked to me to hold the bag in my lap and it wasn't until we started moving that they asked me to stand up and put it in the business class area.

Many others were up and removing their bags from the overhead bins while we were taxiing which lasted for over a half an hour. Flight attendants made no attempt to stop or secure anything.

Arrived at gate 18.30 no one from airline showed up. Monitors showed original departure time well past 19.30. No airport staff inside the departure hall had any answers and no RAM staff were available until 20.10 when the first new departure time update appeared on the monitors. Flight was delayed until 22.15 and no RAM rep bothered to show up at the gate to inform passengers. Finally station manager turned up 20.45 to say that we all should have received food vouchers at check-in but of course he just had to say something.

302,We had no problems in terms of flight times or delays. Flight attendants were quite nonchalant and not particularly friendly. The most worrying thing was the state of the aircraft..

303,Cancelled our original flight to Morocco from JFK due to weather then they failed to notify of the rescheduled time. Because they had failed to notify so many passengers the rescheduled flight was delayed causing us to miss our connection in Casablanca. After having to spend a night in Casablanca we arrived in Marrakech 40 mins late only to discover our bags had been lost. On our return arriving at the airport in Marrakech we went to check-in only to find our flight home was oversold after seeing 3 different agents they finally issued our boarding passes. We thought things were finally running smoothly until we arrived in New York and discovered once again they had lost our bags.

306,"Awful airline and only getting worse. Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase. The suitcase had a huge yellow tag on it that said ""RUSH"" and yet it was 8 hours after it had arrived and no one could confirm it was in Casablance.

307,I cannot recognise the airline that I have used for 20 yrs from some of the comments made. I usually fly Economy LHR to CMN but as I have had a problem with my legs recently I have switched to Business class. In both classes RAM has been totally satisfactory. I have never had a flight cancelled or changed before the day of departure I have only once had a more-than 3 hr delay and in this case cans of drinks were immediately provided and 40 mins later all passengers were taken to a restaurant in the airport. Cabin staff with the odd exception are friendly and helpful especially when they realise I speak some Arabic. The air miles programme is extremely generous. The planes are modern and clean. Even the older planes which I occasionally take on internal flights are satisfactory. One time my baggage went on to Marrakech and was not offloaded at Casa. It arrived back at Casa at 7am the next morning and I was given 300 dirhams compensation for the taxi to and from the airport. This was several years ago and I imagine the compensation will have increased to cater for higher taxi fares.,na,cannot recognise airline used yrs comments made usually fly economy lhr cmn problem legs recently switched business class classes ram totally satisfactory never flight cancelled changed day departure morethan hr delay case cans drinks immediately provided mins later passengers taken restaurant airport cabin staff odd exception friendly helpful especially realise speak arabic air miles programme extremely generous planes modern clean even older planes occasionally take internal flights satisfactory one time baggage went marrakech offloaded casa arrived back casa next morning given dirhams compensation taxi airport several years ago imagine compensation increased cater higher taxi fares

They offered no solution other than a flight 8 days later else I should send a complaint to their email address.

They served lunch which I always love I had the chicken with rice and potatoes very tasty.

Once at JFK I made my way over to the terminal. I had to wait 8 hrs for the plane to show up. I knew this ahead of time the Delta flight was a morning flight and the Royal Air Maroc flight was at 6:32 PM. Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner. There was a menu and all the meals were hot.

314,Not impressed at all. I flew from London Heathrow-Casablanca which was bearable although the staff were very rude and aggressive - they obviously have no customer service skills. I would probably lose my job if I spoke to customers the way this airline's staff do. The return journey was a shambles - the original flight from Marrakech- Casablanca was cancelled and no explanation given so I was put on another flight at a later time which meant I made the connection from Casablanca-Heathrow with mins to spare. Again the staff were rude patronising and arrogant the food was unidentifiable and no apologies were given in respect of the cancelled flight added stress and subsequently lost baggage (which I am still waiting for).,7/10,impressed flew london heathrowcasablanca bearable although staff rude aggressive obviously customer service skills would probably lose job spoke customers way airlines staff return journey shambles original flight marrakech casablanca cancelled explanation given put another flight later time meant made connection casablancaheathrow mins spare staff rude patronising arrogant food unidentifiable apologies given respect cancelled flight added stress subsequently lost baggage still waiting
315,Please do not book with this airline if you want to save yourself the stress anger frustration and rudeness that we experienced. We booked a return flight from LHR-AGA. Our outbound flight was delayed by 4 hrs so we missed our connecting flight from CMN-AGA. It took more than 14 hrs it should have been less than 8 hrs. Our flight home was horrendous. We managed to get a flight from AGA-CMN but as we hurried to get our flight to LHR we were refused boarding even though we had valid boarding passes and tickets. The rude check-in staff told us that there was a problem with our tickets and to speak to our booking agent. It turns out our tickets were cancelled without our permission. We were stranded at the boarding gate. The only reason I could think of was that the airline had double booked their seats because there was a large crowd of passengers before us and 2 more passengers also had their tickets cancelled and were in the same situation as us. The check-in assistant did not help us and sent us from pillar to post asking us to speak to the customer team downstairs when our flight was about to depart. We enquired about getting our luggage back and we were told that it was being offloaded. However our luggage was not offloaded and it flew to LHR. We were told that the next plane to LHR would be in 24 hours. We protested (with 2 other passengers) eventually a person at the airport gave us tickets to LGW (not LHR) which would be a 10 hr trip on 2 planes going via Tunisia. We were not given any food or drink for the inconvenience caused. We arrived at LGW at 1am in the morning without our luggage. We should have been in LHR by 6pm. We had to pay a mighty fare to get from LGW to home we didn't get our luggage for another 3 days.

316,My experience with RAM has been you get less than what you pay for. We were flying NYC to Guinea via Casablanca in NYC it took 2 hours to check us in because the counter person did not know the country code for Guinea and then he lost all the information and then there were issues with not believing a passports validity etc. We were travelling with an infant who was on our lap you must pay to have the infant on your lap which is fine. Except in NYC they booked our daughter on a different flight than us out of Casablanca. We did not notice this until we got to Casablanca. They refused to give my daughter a boarding pass to get on the plane! Saying she had to wait in Casablanca for two more days because that is when her ticket is for - she is 17 months old! We finally managed to find someone with a brain who said to check her in she is an infant - and then the plane was only half full so I really don't understand the problem there! The flight attendants were beyond rude they served drinks only once during an 8 hour flight when I asked for some water for my daughter's cup they would only fill it 25% full - so I had to keep getting up and going to the galley to pour my own drinks.

There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available.

We were then trapped in the duty free airport zone no rep in sight most of the time people at the customer service desk (no English poor French) RAM staff treated us like dirt arrogantly refusing to give information.

327,"London Gatwick to Agadir via Casablanca. On the journey out we were in the queue to check-in at Gatwick for around 2 hours. This meant we had 10 minutes to get to the departure gate for boarding meaning we could not even stop to get refreshments before our flight. When we connected in Casablanca we boarded the plane and were left sitting on the runway in sweltering heat for over an hour without any explanation from cabin crew. On the return flight to England we arrived at Agadir airport at 3.50am to catch a flight to Casablanca at 6.30am where we would connect for London Gatwick. On arrival at the airport we realised that our flight was not on the departures board. We sat and waited for over an hour in a deserted airport with no members of staff or representatives to be seen. When finally a RAM representative did appear he simply shrugged his shoulders and told us that the flight had been cancelled giving us no explanation or apology for this having happened. We tried to patiently negotiate another route but the representative was utterly nonchalant and uncaring about the inconvenience. He worked out a route for us to catch a flight at 9.30am to Casablanca from which we could then connect at 1.40pm to London Heathrow. Although we explained that we had initially booked to go to Gatwick again he simply shrugged and told us that this was our only option and ""take it or leave it"". He even went onto say that it was a difficult situation for him as he was the one who had to listen to us. We waited for 5 and a half hours in Agadir airport to board the 9.30am flight. When we arrived in Casablanca our connecting flight was delayed for an hour and a half meaning we had to sit in the departure lounge listening to a imbecilic woman talking constantly on the tannoy for four hours. When we touched down in Heathrow it was 7pm - 7 hours after we were initially supposed to arrive and at the wrong airport. We were herded from pillar to post once off the plane; initially the gate into the aiport being 'accidentally locked' so we were all standing waiting in a small corridor and then being asked to go back to the departure lounge to wait for further instruction regarding the promise that had been made by the representative in Agadir that we would receive transportation to our homes due to the inconvenience of arriving at the wrong airport. Initially we were told by Heathrow staff that we would only receive transport to Gatwick but after patient negotiation we did get a taxi to our home.

329,I flew RAM last December/January but I'm writing only now because I gave their customer service time to follow up on my complaint which never eventuated. We got to Marrakech via Casablanca from Milan but our luggage did not. It was boarded on the following day's flight (because the cargo was full). This meant waiting in line until midnight to fill out a lost luggage form with the airport authorities. No receipt/copy could be produced as the photocopier was outside the Marrakech airport terminal. This also meant I would have no proof of the incident. They gave us the wrong number to call and it was only thanks to our kind hotel manager that we were able to go back to the airport (paying our own fare) to retrieve our luggage. This some 16 hours after our plane had landed (did I forget to mention we had left Milan 3.5 hours late with no refreshments provided). When I got back to Milan I was instructed by the RAM office in Milan to send a fax (in the era of email correspondence) to their customer care office in Prague (RAM does not even fly to the Czech Republic).

333,We arrived at Gatwick to find the plane supposedly cancelled - apparently nothing new for the Air Maroc flight to Marrakech to be cancelled - what is really meant was that there was to be a 2 hour delay. The service on the flight was extremely poor - my row did not get any food and when we requested it from the air stewards it eventually came with no apology. I waited 30 minutes for a glass of water to take a tablet. The way back to Heathrow was no better. We got to check in very early so we were not sat at the back of the plane - but when we were given our tickets we were at the back on the both our planes (Marrakech to Casablanca Casablanca to Heathrow) - in fact on the first flight we had seats on row 36 despite the plane being a 737-700 with about 26 seats. When we requested to be moved further forward we were told that row 38 on the second plane was at the front of the plane and that the seating configuration was reversed on this plane.

334,Dreadful service and communication from this airline. Returning from Marrakesh to Heathrow on with four children we along with 20 other passengers were held for 24 hours in transit at Casablanca. Apparently the airline had double booked the seats. However all our luggage flew with the original plane. No food or hotel was offered. No manager was available.

335,Terrible service do not fly with this airline. We were delayed for more than 7 hours in Marrakech and were told that there was no plane to take us by some staff and no pilot to fly it by other staff. We were never told why by the Royal Air Maroc staff although we asked repeatedly. UK systems showed our flight as having departed when we were still in the airport to those waiting for us. A further delay of 10 hours was threatened and only narrowly avoided by persistent negotiation with airline staff. The airline did provide food but tried everything they could to avoid it adding a huge amount to the stress. I was abandoned at 3:30am in Gatwick with no way of continuing my onward journey and nowhere to stay. Gatwick information were told by a Royal Air Maroc represeentative at 4 am that passengers should make their own way home. When we landed we were told they hoped we had enjoyed our flight!,na,terrible service fly airline delayed hours marrakech told plane take us staff pilot fly staff never told royal air maroc staff although asked repeatedly uk systems showed flight departed still airport waiting us delay hours threatened narrowly avoided persistent negotiation airline staff airline provide food tried everything could avoid adding huge amount stress abandoned gatwick way continuing onward journey nowhere stay gatwick information told royal air maroc represeentative passengers make way home landed told hoped enjoyed flight
336,Terrible. Worst experience ever. They are not to blame for the weather induced delays but they are to blame for the lack of communication with passengers and the uncooperative disposition of their staff.

338,"Seems we were lucky to get to Marrakech from Gatwick on our booked flight with our luggage. On the way back flight changed to call in at Casablanca. Wrong check in queue on departure board. Check in 2 hr early still left luggage in Marrakech when we got to Edinburgh with BA from Heathrow 15 hours later. It arrived at our home 2 days later. Seat legroom awful. Poor safety checking of seat belts etc on passengers. No decaf coffee or green tea and no politeness when told so. Very poor information to passengers when delayed in Casablanca for 2 hours for ""air conditioning check"" and ""luggage does not match passengers"". Very late lunch had to use own reserve food. Assured we would get connecting flight even half an hour before arrival; but taking 40 min to get to standstill after delayed estimated landing time resulted in a disordered mutiny of passengers trying to get off and panicky staff.

339,London-Fes via Casablanca. Connecting flight delayed nearly 3 hours amidst much confusion and RAM intentionally left much of the baggage behind in Casablanca. We were later told that this is a routine practice on this sector due to the limited capacity of the ATR72 used. We had to queue for an hour at 1am to register a lost baggage claim. When our bags reached Fes over 24 hours later we had to return to the airport to collect them because of 'security'.,2/10,londonfes via casablanca connecting flight delayed nearly hours amidst much confusion ram intentionally left much baggage behind casablanca later told routine practice sector due limited capacity atr used queue hour register lost baggage claim bags reached fes hours later return airport collect security
340,London Gatwick - Marrakech. The snow brought the worst out of Royal Air Maroc. Chaotic check in with passengers from the previous day trying to book onto flights. No information and rude check-in staff. Flight did eventually go 4 hours late. My biggest complaint was lack of communication about the delay and rude disinterested staff. Food was OK legroom was terrible and seat was very uncomfortable. Safety demonstration was lacklustre and was a mish-mash of 3 languages.

346,Of the 6 flights (2 international and 4 domestic; Madrid-Marrakesh; Essaouira-Casablanca; Casablanca-Fez; Casablanca-Ouarzazate; Ouarzazate-Casablanca; Casablanca-Amsterdam ) only one was on time. The rest delayed for at least an hour. The longest delay was 12 hours for a flight which only took 30 minutes! The problem - there was simply no plane available to bring us to our destination although it was a normal scheduled flight. The only positive thing about the airline is that they put you in a good hotel to wait/spend the night. But I guess that is because they have a lot of experience with that - I will certainly not choice this airline again.,7/10,flights international domestic madridmarrakesh essaouiracasablanca casablancafez casablancaouarzazate ouarzazatecasablanca casablancaamsterdam one time rest delayed least hour longest delay hours flight took minutes problem simply plane available bring us destination although normal scheduled flight positive thing airline put good hotel waitspend night guess lot experience certainly choice airline

348,"This is the most unorganized air line I have ever flown. They lost both of our checked bags going to our destination. Try as they would they never managed to get those bags to us. At one point they told us our bags were being shipped UPS. I told them I called UPS and they had no record of any such shipment; I asked RAM to give me the confirmation number so I could call UPS back - RAM hung up on me. Then on the way back we checked in one bag and yes they lost that one too. For our boarding on the way back they called for general boarding and everyone hoarded around the door in one big general mass. So then they decided to let families on board first - it was chaos because everyone was already jammed together. People were trying to squeeze through babies being squashed children crying. One couple complained profusely that it doesn't make any sense to call for general boarding and then limit it to only families. The RAM attendant responded that it wasn't his job to ""organize you people"". Really? And if it isn't their job to organize boarding it really makes me wonder about other things.

349,My wife and I flew with this airline from London to Fez via Casablanca. The outward journey went without problem but the return was a different story. We left ample time for our connection but the Fez flight took off an hour and a half late. I talked to the cabin crew about our connection and asked them to radio ahead they said there would be no problem. When we got to Casablanca the flight had gone and there was nobody from Royal Air Maroc to meet us. We had to find their office ourselves which was tucked away in arrivals. The attendent said come back tomorrow and catch the flight then. We had a discussion and made them book us on a flight to Amsterdam and then KLM to London but got to London so late we had to stay there the night before catching our train to Manchester. We complained via eBookers who tried hard to contact Royal Air Maroc. We also wrote a letter of complaint but no replies leaving us £206 pounds out of pocket.

350,Have had an awful experience with this airline on 2 occasions. On my first trip between Heathrow to Tangier I was contacted by phone 4 days before the departure date to be told that there was no direct flight anymore and I had to transit via Casablanca (transit time 6 hours!). I was offered the option to cancel my flight against full refund however till today I have not received anything despite numerous e-mail and phone complaints. On another trip between Casablanca and Accra the plane was delayed for 5 hours at departure and 3 hours in the return journey (needless to mention the rudeness of the ground and cabin staff and low- service quality).,4/10,awful experience airline occasions first trip heathrow tangier contacted phone days departure date told direct flight anymore transit via casablanca transit time hours offered option cancel flight full refund however till today received anything despite numerous email phone complaints another trip casablanca accra plane delayed hours departure hours return journey needless mention rudeness ground cabin staff low service quality
