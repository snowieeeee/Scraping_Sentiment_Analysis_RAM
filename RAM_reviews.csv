"✅Trip Verified| Very smooth check-in at Casablanca though security and passport checks were cumbersome. Boarding was by bus, which was reasonably efficient. Onboard the crew was friendly and a boxed snack and soft drinks were served. The seat was fine for a 2-hour flight. The plane arrived in Barcelona on time, but there was a lengthy wait for luggage on the carousel. Overall a pleasant late-afternoon flight.",4/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Royal Air Maroc is bar none the best airline I’ve ever flown. You could tell they take pride of their service. I wish I could use it all the time but with my extensive travel, they cannot accommodate my destinations. From the captain to the crew members working the flight are so attentive and knowledgeable. They’re here to please you at any time and you don’t have to wait if you have a request. I flew a 787 and it’s was clean and in a pristine condition. Plenty leg room. We had no cancellations or delays and the most important thing, my luggage’s arrived in perfect condition. Royal Air Maroc, thank you for your service. I give 10 out 10 for your service.",7/10
"Not Verified| There is a need for an upgrade in the seats as they are not comfortable. Additionally, the touch screen system requires improvement as it currently offers outdated movies and series compared to other airlines. While the food and staff are satisfactory, it has been noticed over the past five years that the seats and entertainment system have become outdated.",10/10
"Not Verified|  This is, without doubt, the worst airline I have ever flown on. They changed my initial flight at least 4 times, then cancelled it the day before the trip and the new flight was delayed. This meant we missed our connection to New York. No explanation given. We missed our first day in New York and our family who were waiting there for us. They put us up overnight in a Hotel which felt like a detention centre. On return they kept us standing at Check In for an hour to board the flight, then the in flight films and entertainment did not function, staff were unsympathetic, seats were not comfortable enough for long haul. Never again on this airline, never.",2/10
"✅Trip Verified|  London Heathrow to Roberts international Monrovia.  Arrived at Roberts international to find all six pieces of checked baggage were lost it turns out that as far as I could see nobody on the flight received their luggage as all the luggage put out for collection had tags from previous flights. Royal air Maroc staff at the airport were overwhelmed and unable to control 100+ angry travelers. We left the airport on local advice as tempers were being lost and things were starting to look ugly and unsafe. Attended the Royal air Maroc offices in Monrovia several times but staff were rude and unhelpful, on Saturday the 30th December we made a final attempt to collect our luggage only to find the Liberian national guard wearing riot gear were protecting the Sinkor office from angry customers, honestly you could not make this up if you tried. My baggage eventually arrived a week after I had returned to the UK! The tickets were cheap and we got there and back in one piece so if you have a sense of adventure, are fine with dated aircraft and only have hand luggage they might be worth a punt.",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Bag did not arrive at destination. Freetown was unable to log in WorldTracer as they did not have a computer. The bag randomly arrived a week late after I left. Freetown tagged the bag and returned to Heathrow with my details on the top of the bag, but because it wasn't in the system it arrived and has gone missing. RAM customer services refuse to acknowledge the bags existence and won't contact anyone at the airport to assist the tracking. I have an airtag and have given them the locations, but now the bag is missing and they won't acknowledge the 21 day limit as I did not put the details in worldtracer. The tell me 'they will contact me when it's found - I found it, I told them were it was, and they refused to help repatriate it. The plane was old, crew woke up passengers for no necessary reason during the redeye. Avoid at all costs.",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Good experience on these flights which were pretty much on time. Business Class service was not outstanding but OK. Since Royal Air Maroc is already good in Economy Class, I question the added value to this flight in Business Class with the slightly better food and the still outdated seating comfort without any added value as charging facilities for your devices or an online access for messages as it would be state of the art. A curiosity on its own is the baggage handling at the hub of Casablanca. All my three checked suitcases did not arrive on time, two with three and one with six days delay. Watch the picture. It looked like that at every gate and all around the terminal. At the end, it is like a mystery that all suitcases arrived well",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  The cabins are little old but what else should an airline do as a Boeing customer waiting to replace them with new 737-MAX? Service was very good on the entire two flights, both time a hot and very tasty meal was served including free beverages, as soft drinks, wines and the famous Moroccan mint tea. Funny was the inflight online access to a very old presentation of RAM from times before they joined the One World alliance as well as with COVID-19 - measures. Both flights were punctual as well. One of my two checked luggage arrived two days later even as being a One World Sapphire client with ""priority"" sticker on it. Besides the baggage handling, I can strongly recommend Royal Air Maroc.",6/10
"Not Verified| My 16 yro son missed his connection fight. They did not put in an effort to assist him, they were arrogant and unfriendly. He was really frustrated. As a parent this was a nightmare for me. I would not recommend this airline to anyone.",7/10
"Not Verified| Unresolved Baggage Delay - Royal Air Maroc. I want to express my disappointment with Royal Air Maroc regarding a baggage delay issue I encountered during my recent flight. Despite my efforts to claim the delayed baggage, the process yielded no results. The lack of resolution and communication on their part added frustration to an already inconvenient situation. I hope the airline addresses these issues promptly to enhance customer satisfaction and reliability.",1/10
"Not Verified| This airline is the worst ever I have experienced, I boarded the plane from Lagos to London and the organisation was the worst I have ever seen, customers were treated as animals, with little or no regards for us. My luggages were misplaced, they promised that it will be sent to our location which they did not. I had to call to ask for my bags, the response I got was that they can’t find my name in the boarding list for the day I travelled, I thought it was dream. I was so frustrated, I had to leave work and go to the airport to get my bag, only to see that my bag was with them, the lock was broken, my bag was torn and there was no form of apology from the staff on that. I will advise people to never use this airline or any service related to Royal Air Maroc.",4/10
✅Trip Verified|  It has been 5 days since I travel with this terrible airline and my 2 luggage aren’t still found. The customer service is not helpful in the process and I am completely hopeless to find it.,1/10
"Not Verified|  My flight got cancelled on the first day for no reason after checking in & waiting to board at the boarding gate for hours! We were then checked out, stressed out & told to return the following day, same time for the next flight… the following day we were given one boarding pass for a connecting flight that was meant to have 2 boarding passes. London to Casablanca & then Casablanca to Lagos… We arrived in Casablanca but unfortunately we are told there's no flights connecting to Lagos, nobody explained anything to us, we were stranded at the airport and had to sleep at the airport until the following night..... spending 3 days in transit for a journey that was meant to last for a day! They clearly knew what they were doing… they were trying to save costs at our expense…they probably didn’t wanna lodge us in a hotel for another day in London & also in Casablanca. 3 family members have had stressful and exhausting experiences using this airline! I thought mine was gonna be different but clearly not! Nobody in my family is flying this airline anymore never again.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|   Cabin staff not very pleasant to me. On arrival at Dulles, Washington, both of my 2 suitcases did not arrive, one containing my clothes and the other full of valuable sentimental belongings for my daughter. Extremely distraught as it has now been over two weeks and no effort is being made to locate them, phoning everyday to no avail, 15 email's all unanswered, no customer service return calls updating situation and 5 separate claims made. I have been without clothes or personal items and still have 3 weeks of stay left.. I am absolutely furious and seems there is nothing else I can do,",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  On 24th October, 2023 I checked in my baggage with Royal Air Maroc flight number AT911 (IST - CMN) and AT555 (CMN - LOS) but I was unable to board because I was delayed by the immigration. On getting to Lagos on 2nd November with same airline, my luggage never arrived my final destination. I have since filed a report but the airline has been sluggish about my case.  It has really been heartbreaking as the customer service has been very poor. None of the emails I sent delivered. What do I do to get my bag? I'm fed up.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  All was ok, but staff cabin crew need to do better with economy passengers. I didn’t appreciate the tone of One of the staff from the Nigeria flight. I just needed water for my baby and I kept saying excuse me, didn’t know he heard me but just didn’t want to answer yet, by the time he answered, the tone sounded like I was disturbing him. I feel staff should use soft tones for passengers. The other connecting flight from Casablanca to London, after I left the flight, I noticed that my child’s seat belt still hung on to me, so I needed to return it. I kept saying excuse me to one of the lady cabin crew who was also chatting with someone else, she didn’t answer, I kept saying excuse me, then she said I will get to you in such a diminishing tone, without eye contact after severally trying to get her attention. Then I had to say and show your belt, that was when she gave me audience with smiles. Kindness and patience should be key for staff and passengers too.",2/10
"Not Verified|  I was flying from Casablanca to Washington after a long 10 day trip. The flight was delayed for nearly 4 hours, but there was minimal communication as to why or when the flight would actually take off. The website stated the flight left with only a short delay and the internal screens updated with the next flight, but we had not even boarded yet. When we were finally allowed to pass through the gate, we boarded busses where we sat for at least another hour. On the flight, they refused alcohol service even after the long wait. The food was awful. The attendants weren't friendly. The worst experience I have had, I will never fly them again",6/10
"Not Verified| Dear Royal Air Maroc, I am writing to formally complain about the extremely high ticket change fees, terrible flight service, and overall awful experience my partner and I encountered regarding relocating after the major earthquake in Morocco. We have previously asked for a refund by following the directions on your website; thus far, no one from Royal Air Maroc has not responded to our requests. As you know, on Friday, September 8th, at 11:11 pm local time, a massive 6.8 earthquake struck Marrakech, where we were vacationing. This powerful quake caused extensive damage across the region. For safety reasons, we had to relocate from Marrakech to Casablanca on Sunday, September 10th, to catch an earlier flight home. We were initially scheduled to fly Royal Air Maroc from Marrakech to New York on September 14th, flight number AT0202. Due to the earthquake, I contacted your team to change our flight to depart Casablanca on September 10th instead. While I appreciate accommodating this change, I was utterly shocked to be charged an exorbitant $2,321.09 change fee. Given that this unforeseen natural disaster forced us to alter plans, such excessive fees seem highly unethical. I request an immediate refund of the full $2,321.09. Customers should not pay penalties for ensuring safety after a devastating earthquake. Adding to our misery, the service on flight AT0202 on September 10th from Casablanca to New York was abysmal. The plane's bathroom sink was clogged, we could not wash our hands, and the bathroom floor was filthy wet, and slippery. The staff were completely absent and unhelpful, ignoring passenger requests. In summary, between the egregious fees and terrible flight service, this was an awful travel experience. I hope Royal Air Marco will refund the $2,321.09 in change fees and address the cleanliness and service issues on AT0202.",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  They canceled my fully refundable ticket because on the pandemic on April 2020 and have been refusing to give me my money back for 3 years and 5 months! Shame on you royal air Maroc.,1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  My worst flight experience I have ever had in my life since I have been travelling is with Royal Air Maroc. We received the worst service ever. From London to Douala, we did nor receive any of our suit cases. We received them after 5 days. From Douala to London Heathrow, we did not receive our suit cases on  the day of travel. We received the 1st 6 bags after two weeks with the goods completely bad. I received a call from the Airline asking me to come to London Airport and collect a bag. Royal Air Maroc caused the luggage delay, as a result, things went bad and they asked me to take a day off work and pay train ticket to come and collect a rotten bag.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  I had the worst experience. I booked my flight in June 2019. Due to covid 19 pandemic, they cancelled my flight and issued a travel voucher claiming that in case of non-use within 1 year, I will receive a refund equivalent to the amount of my ticket (USD 590) upon request. When the time was due, i requested a refund in and within the following 2 years, i've been sending numerous reminders, trying to contact them by phone without any reply.  On March 2, 2022, I received an email from them asking for a copy of my IBAN to issue a refund. I sent all the required documents and to the present day (September 4, 2023), I have not received a single reply from them. I kept calling the customer service who always claim that there is nothing they can do except raising the issue to another department. I asked for an alternative and they stated that the department responsible for handling my case is located in their Head Office in Morocco and they have no way for me to contact them.",4/10
"✅Trip Verified|  The flight was a red eye which are always stressful on passengers and crew the seats on the RAM 787 in business class are the best I have experienced. I am 192 cm and can lie easily flat. The cabin crew were below average, catering was disappointing though the portions were generous but never reflective to the rich Moroccan heritage except for the Moroccan tea. IFE was awful with a very poor selection of movies, TV and games.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| I will never use this airline again - the aircraft that they fly to most of their African destinations are fantastically old, filthy and their cabins are terribly maintained. They have a quick turnaround when they arrive at the airport - which means they are punctual. However, experience of my last flight made me realise that they aren't cleaned properly after the passengers have embarked off. So the seats have disgusting left overs, the floor has empty bottles of waters and cans of beer, which makes the already old aircraft so unappealing to sit in. As for the pilots - I am not sure how they are trained. I am a pilot myself, so I can tell when the landing is so so bumpy - when it shouldn't be - since they are coming in at a higher speed than they should be. This leads to an outrageous breaking that makes the whole landing experience so traumatic. The captain who did OK to make us arrive 16.30 on 24th June 2023, was simply awful at the landing. He broke so so hard and inconsistently making passengers unnecessarily uncomfortable, worried and traumatised. I will never fly them again.",6/10
"✅Trip Verified|  We had to make a name correction for the booking due to a well-documented marriage/legal name change process. Royal Air Maroc made us cancel and re-book the flight. Besides losing most of the money for the original ticket, we had to pay several hundred dollars extra for the new flight. This is a poor, inflexible policy and it should be revised. I am writing this complaint before the flight because it is specifically a complaint about customer service and airline policies.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| The toilets were often in a disgusting state. Flight attendant opened the bathroom whilst it was locked before take-off, and without even knocking. The food options are not great, especially non-meat options. No entertainment options or charging outlets on the  plane. No warning of certain scheduled routes (e.g., the Guinea-Bissau stop in the Casablanca-Praia route).",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  We were very pleased with our flight. The plane was large, modern and comfortable, entertainment was excellent and the food was good. Our luggage were handled properly. I would fly with them again. The airport in Casablanca need some attention to cleanliness and facilities.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| The departure from HIA airport was very smooth, I had an 4kg extra in my suitcase and they were okay with it they didn’t charge anything. The cabin crew wasn’t that friendly, I asked them to bring me beverages more and they never bring it,  The touch screen at my seat wasn’t working.",9/10
✅Trip Verified|  Overall the experience wasn’t bad. Party of 3 adults actually booked on 2 separate reservations. Check in at Miami was easy. We did the 24 hr layover to experience Casablanca (which was the whole reason we chose the airline). We had confusion initially on if we would get our bags in CMN. The third person in our party had a late connection into Miami and her luggage said it was checked to CMN. Ours was checked to BCN. However her bag did not show up in CMN. Staff was nice and willing to help but their customer service was what I found to be typical for the country just lacking by American standards. Plane was clean. Food was good. The flight itself was actually a great experience. Better than most US airlines.,1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  The check in counter is slow in Dubai. The flight was also delayed. The food portions are really good although you might find the bread hard. The cabin crew didn't answer call bells, they would =turn it off cleverly while passing by.",9/10
Not Verified|  I appreciate travelling with Royal Air Maroc. The boarding has gone smooth. The staff is wonderful and very helpful. I recommend for any customer.,6/10
"Not Verified|  Worst airline I have ever traveled with. Delayed baggage on both ends. Delayed carry-on for a week on the way back with all my essentials in it. Broke one of my suitcases on the way back. Customer service keep lying and then stops responding to emails altogether. They ignored the reports and the proofs that were sent to them by email. Very disappointing experience, the staff were very rude and not understanding. They made me bring a toddler car seat to the plane door while I had a stroller and a baby with me. I have never done this with any airline. The car seats get checked in with the rest of the luggage in general. It is more than 10kg and you can't expect a person to carry that to the plane door in their hand. Please avoid this airline especially if you are traveling with kids.",4/10
"✅Trip Verified| We got delayed in Accra for hours only to miss our connecting flight to London. Hence, I had to stay overnight in Casablanca. At Casablanca, the food was very poor, with no vegan options. The hostel room was dusty with dirty used bedsheets and dirty bathrooms as well. We could not find toothbrushes, toothpaste, or even towels at duty-free shops. Their staff were very extremely rude and were not remorseful. Some passengers amongst us had to stay for 2-3 nights because there were no vacancies on the next connecting flights to their respective destinations. And when we complained, instead of feeling remorseful and issuing apologies, they’d rather tell us to return to Ghana and join another airline. I missed a very important meeting, the very reason why I had to travel, hence my trip was in vain, thanks to the incompetence and inefficiency of the airline I chose! It’s been more than a month now, and no one has reached out to apologise for all the opportunities we lost because of their failed operations. There’s no way I’d advise anyone to choose Royal Air Maroc. In summary - it was a horrible experience.",2/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Madrid to Casablanca on 15th February 2023. I booked my flight online via a travel agency several months before travel and it was reassuring to have received a number of superbly informative emails from Royal Air Maroc before the flight. The airline enabled online check-in and this attention to detailed was mirrored elsewhere in the service provided. My one and only gripe was the abrupt woman on the check-in desk. She made no effort to even speak to me and roughly removed the protective cover to my passport and literally threw it under the counter at me. When I objected she turned her head and entered into a conversation with her uniformed colleagues. This rudeness is not acceptable and was entirely unnecessary too. the boarding process was well managed and the crew were well turned out and very professional. The interior of the 737-Max was tastefully decorated in a corporate and culturally reflective manner. Royal Air Maroc provided a nicely presented lunch box. The box itself was a work of art. It contained a small cake, sandwich and water and other items I do not recall. A route map was displayed and the cabin crew made themselves present. The lavatory was spotlessly clean. Although a relatively short flight the crew were a superb representation of their company and country. Landing and disembarkation were professionally handled and based on this experience, I would certainly use again. Royal Air Maroc put certain European airlines to shame. As mentioned, my one and only and justifiable gripe is the rude woman on the Madrid check-in desk.",1/10
"Not Verified|  Used to be a frequent flyer - will no longer travel with the RAM. They kept my refund for nearly two years now! During COVID time, one of my flights had an issue and I had to cancel the flight in May 2021. RAM policy was to issue a voucher for one year and if the voucher was not used, to issue a refund at the end of the one year period. In May 2022, I immediately applied for a refund of the voucher. We are now in January 2023 (20 months later) and I have yet to receive my refund, nearly two years later. RAM customer service has been very unhelpful. Every call I have been told that I must be patient and nothing could be done as they receive a large number of request. Withholding money from a customer for nearly two years is unacceptable and completely took away my trust in the ethic of the company. I will never travel again with RAM.",8/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Worst airline experience I have had in a long time. No orderly boarding in Montreal or Casablanca, no use of the zones on the boarding passes, no clear announcements, no communication when flight delayed. So people formed their own line, a mile long, and stood there for an hour waiting. No guidance whatsoever from boarding crew. The cabin was spartan - no seatback entertainment. In fact, they didn't even use their own aircraft on the transatlantic flight, but a budget Spanish aircraft. The free hotel in Casablanca was a bad joke. The flight arrived late in the first place; we waited in the airport for hours to get transported all the way into the city (another hour). There were about 75 of us, all herded like cattle, all made to wait at each step of the way for all the other passengers to be processed. Upon arrival at the hotel, we waited another hour in the lobby while they processed us one by one. By the time we reached our room, it was 6 hours after the original landing time. On the return flight, boarding in Casablanca, it was raining heavily in Casablanca. Nevertheless, they herded us onto buses, then opened the bus doors in the pouring rain with no provision for cover. The first passengers who were foolish enough to try to board were completely drenched, because they reached the steps, and then the line moved so slowly to enter the aircraft and most had to stand in the pouring rain for 15 minutes until the finally reached the door. Completely soaked, half of the passengers. No cover, no guidance, no assistance, no staff anywhere in sight. The smart ones (me) waited in the bus for 15 minutes until the line disappeared, then ran onto the plane. Terrible treatment. The only reason I would ever fly RAM again is if the ticket is thousands of dollars cheaper than the alternatives.",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  Had a terrible experience with loss of our luggage on this airline. We checked 5 bags and only received one on 12/26/2022. The other four bags are missing and the airline is incapable or unwilling to locate them. They have been unresponsive and incompetent in handling our claim. Do not recommend flying this airline.,1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  On the trip into Marrakech, they lost part of our luggage and we had to keep making trips to airport because no one picked up the phone. On the way back, we had a 7 hr layover with a chance at a hotel but security at the airport told us we couldn’t go through international transit (flight got in at 11pm with connections at 7am). When we got to the RAM office, they told us only the international transit desk could provide the hotel. Then security wouldn’t let us into the terminal until 5am which was a real joy with a 4 yr old and a 6yr old. The man in the domestic accommodation office offered nothing at all and was completely dismissive. We were told we should have stayed in the terminal by numerous RAM personnel while airport security provided continuous conflicting information.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Scheduled departure 11:25 am, fully boarded 10 mins ahead of time and then we sat for a full two hours without so much as a single acknowledgment or announcement from the crew, no one walking around with water or any amenities and the attitude of the crew when asked is to merely shrug. The lack of any sense of customer service is truly appalling.  Never going to come anywhere near this airline again.",1/10
"Not Verified|  Our destination was Freetown via Casablanca travelling with my daughter. The flight was 4 hours delayed in London. Arrived in Casablanca, connecting flight had left without us. The staff were very unhelpful with our options and places us in a place called ""the Lounge"" it was little worse than a prison and stank. There were limited beds and I shared a sofa bed with my daughter. The toilet facilities were very poor. In the morning we were not taken to the airport due to lack of space on the plane, we then had to wait the whole day until midnight for a plane to take us to Sierra Leone. I would plead with anyone who wants to retain their sanity and their self worth not to travel with RAM.",2/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Been the worst travel experience, our flight was supposed to take off 11am Qatar time, we flew until 6pm with no regards to our schedule, no communication from the company, the flight, seats, staff, everything was horrible. We landed early morning on the next day, to find out that our luggage was left behind in Doha and no explanation provided at the airport in Casablanca by staff. The best of all is that they tried to blame Qatar authorities for that, no ownership taken, came back next day on my cost and had no clothes to wear, had to buy new personal care stuff early morning to refresh myself, and drive again back to Casablanca from Rabat, just to find that both my suitcases arrived broken,. Tried to file a complaint and up till now no replies by email and been trying to call same way no answers.",1/10

"✅Trip Verified| I had a first time flight with Royal Air Moroc on the 6 November and I wanted to express gratitude for such a comfortable flight.

"✅Trip Verified|  This review relates to the second Royal Air Maroc flight I took, on a Boeing 737-800 from Casablanca to Paris Orly Airport. The gate staff were rather bureaucratic and unfriendly and I saw one staff member walk away from an elderly woman who needed and asked for assistance. Boarding was fairly orderly and one gained the impression of a very clean and nicely set out interior reflecting Moroccan designs and culture. The crew were a little cold but very correct in terms of their service. It was great to see a proper breakfast served to the passengers. My concern was that a clearly very sick woman was allowed to board the flight. She hardly stopped coughing for the entire duration of the flight and did not use a face mask at all. The captain did not give much information and announcements were made only in Arabic and French. Disembarkation was via a bridge and there were some uniformed RAM staff waiting to assist needy passengers. Overall this was a good experience and I would recommend this airline without hesitation!",10/10
✅Trip Verified|  I flew with Royal Air Maroc on a domestic flight from Tangiers to Casablanca on 28th October 2022. The thing I liked about this airline was the superb communication via email. The airline made sure I was made aware of a slight change to the check-in time and to a change of aircraft. This was a very early departure to connect with an international flight in Casablanca. The interior of the aircraft was tasteful and the crew were very well presented. Safety was taken seriously and the crew were pleasant and very professional. I was impressed with the service and the comfortable Boeing 737 used on this occasion. As this was a very short and incredibly early morning departure there was no food or drinks served alas. I should like to commend the very professional ground staff who were friendly and proactive.,9/10
"✅Trip Verified|  The flight with Royal Air Maroc was average. My seat wasn't clean.  Unfortunately, the airline lost my suitcase. I made a loss report and a list of valuables. The airline does not respond to more than 40 messages. Inadequate customer service. Unfortunately, I am stuck here with damage of 1,500 euros and had no clothes etc. for the entire holiday.",7/10
"Not Verified| Casablanca to Dubai. I received a confirmation mail after my payment (with SMS proving it) on early July 2022. 2 months later, I tried to check in the day of departure of my flight and I had an error, indicating that I should contact call center. They indicated that they never received the payment and hence never issued the ticket. I checked my bank account and indeed it seems the payment did not go through for some reason. Now what makes me insane is: - WHY does the company send emails to confirm the flight if there is an issue in the payment? - WHY no one at RAM notified me that there was a payment issue? A simple automated email would have sufficed - WHY the service agent was so rude in handling my request. Clearly he did not put himself in client shoes when asking me to pay 3 times the initial price to fix the issue and did not apologize any single time. He did not allow me to speak to his manager. An airline company without an escalation path is a red flag. For those who can, I heavily suggest to avoid them at all cost. Since I could not fly with them, I rated 1 for the handling of my ticket and 3 for the flight related aspects in order to keep a neutral rating",1/10
"Not Verified| Dubai to Casablanca. I booked a one way ticket with this horrible company for 5th of July for 2259.00 AED, but due to an emergency i had to book another one on 21st of June with almost the same amount 2235.00AED. So when I reached Morocco, I called to asked for refund of the first ticket, I got an answer after 3 days of continuously calling, the lady who answered me was super rude and impolite, I explained to her the situation however, nothing happened its been more than 2 months now still waiting for a refund which basically wont ever happen, cause my big mistake is to travel with a low performance airline company, full of thieves and uneducated customer service agents whom me and another traveler paying their salaries. Worst experience ever",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  I traveled with RAM on 20th July to Lagos with 6 luggages checked in, only for none to arrive on arrival at my destination. Got 3 of 6 luggage after 6 days of arrival and remaining 3 no where to be found. I returned to the UK on 1st August and still unable to get my remaining 3 luggages. Tried to contact RAM on the phone but no response. RAM has no contact number for customer service and complaint. It’s really a shame and I will never recommend RAM.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  I purchased travel insurance when I bought the airline tickets, and the tickets purchase was accepted, but without my consent, the insurance was taken out. When I then had to cancel my flight, it was impossible to get a response from the airline. No one seemed to know anything, and I was refunded less than half of the ticket price.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| I had no problem from NYC to Casablanca, I checked one bag and had a small carry-on bag. They gave me a red tag to place on the carry-on saying ""carry-on"". As I was going up the stairs to board the second plan from Casablanca to Cairo. I was told that I have to check the bag since this is a smaller plane and there is no room for my bag! I replied that the bag has medication that I need, so I was asked to get it out. I found myself opening the bag on the ground and going through my personal items, not finding what I am looking for since it was dark. At that point I felt so humiliated and told the crew that I will take my bag with me or I will not board the plane. After a few minutes with heated loud voice debate I boarded the plane with my bag to find the plane having plenty of room to the point that my bag was the only bag in the overhead compartment. I really regret choosing Royal Moroccan Airlines and promised myself to share my story with everyone I know to avoid their services.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Service on board was sub-par. No smiles, no pleasantries with mediocre food at best. Take your meal, shut up and do not bother us is how I felt the entire flight. No rounds for beverages unless it was with meal service any other time you had to go to the galley to ask for something because the entire crew lounged in the galley chatting. Very disappointed and totally blew my dream of flying Royal Air Maroc which should remove the word ROYAL and simply be named Air Maroc because northing was ROYAL!",4/10
"✅Trip Verified|  My flight was cancelled in December 2021 and I’ve been calling every week for a refund and all they tell me is, we will send a reminder. It’s April 2022 and I haven’t heard anything and no refund as of today.",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Although we booked and paid for a direct return flight from Toulouse, on the return leg we were delayed from 08:05 AM local to 09:05 and a then to 1:25pm. We were then told the flight would first go to Bordeaux for technical reasons. We then had to wait on the plane for most of the passengers to disembark and new ones to come on: so we also had to take our hand baggage out of the overhead lockers to check nothing was left behind and then put it back again. The staff never apologised for everything we went through and the terrible delays: we were originally due to land in Toulouse at 12:30 pm, but instead we arrived close to 8pm! When we pointed this out, the stewardess was extremely rude saying it’s not their job to do so.  Also my food was beyond awful! We shall not fly with this airline again.",1/10
"Not Verified|  Pure, literal hell. Unlike anything I've experienced before. Makes sub-Saharan African airlines look like Virgin Atlantic. My itinerary was Barcelona - Casablanca - JFK. The flight itself was like a Marrakesh gypsy market. Seemingly unattended children coughing, crying and sneezing for 8 hours. Absolutely no masks worn and 0 enforcement attempts. The whole plane is a Covid super spreader event. Seats so small you couldn't stand up unless someone else did on either side of you. If the person in front of you leans back in their chair, your tray essentially collapses so you better not be eating at the time. Sound does not work on the entertainment system. No alcohol served, obviously. Terrible food. Rude/confused staff that throw things at you, like broken headphones, when you're sleeping. Limited ability for the crew to communicate in Spanish, English or French. The layover in Casablanca was supposed to be 50 minutes but was more like 15 so crazy running through the gates and then 3 rounds of security (the security being a teenager lazily unzipping your bag). Maybe this flight was a parody, a social experiment for how much abuse people are willing to take to save $300 on a Transatlantic flight. Never again. Do not punish yourself like this.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| Nice flight with Royal Air Maroc from Spain to Morocco. Aircraft was clean, leg space very good. Food and all type of drinks were included. First service very fast and later on attentive on request. An airline to be recommended.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified| The plane (737-800) was dirty and in bad condition on the inside, with bits of plastic insulation missing. There was a strong smell of toilet chemical and the seat tray and back of the seat in front was sticky. No PTV. The seats themselves were worn out and wonky. Casablanca airport was a hot disorganised mess, with confusing signs, long queues, nowhere to sit and buses that didn't seem to know where they were going. Food options there were overpriced and very poor quality. The domestic leg of my return flight was cancelled, adding an overnight stop in Casablanca. They ignored my emails and I had to call at 5am and hold for 30m to finally get through - the rest of the time they just hung up the phone and sent messages saying that they were busy. They agreed to change my ticket to a same-day connection on Turkish Airlines, which was 100 times better. The only thing I liked about RAM was the food, which was actually very tasty (delicious chicken or fish). They really need to update their interiors, employ more call centre staff and fix the horrible mess at Casablanca. Make it a place that is pleasant to transit, rather than a hassle. Also, it would be nice if they would stop cancelling flights.",9/10
"✅Trip Verified|  I have flown with RAM in the past and did not have the greatest experience in that the aircraft seemed old.  All I can say is , wow they have really improved. The airplane was brand new and quite comfortable. The flight attendants were very attentive and kind. The food was very good and every 2 hours they were bringing personal bottles of water. I would say if you had a bad experience in the past, definitely give them another try and you will be pleasantly surprised.",5/10
"Not Verified|  Amazing airline. Highly recommended. I fly from Newark International to Casablanca International Airport on the 787-9 Dreamliner. We got good Legroom, Inflight entertainment with countless movies and many more! The food was the usual chicken, fish or beef, I got the standard beef. There was rice dessert and some drinks so it was like any other airline. Too me it didn't feel different and felt normal and it was pretty clean. Again recommended if your flying to Morocco or from Morocco choose Royal Air Maroc. There's also a really nice Business class but I wasn't in it I just saw it.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  I booked to fly to Sierra Leone (cost for 2 people, £1009) but due to the pandemic we weren't able to fly (flight was booked for Oct 2020, and was cancelled). So i called them and asked what we needed to do. I was told that as the tickets were non-refundable, I needed to pay a service charge (£306) to get a voucher for the flights (to the value of £1009). So i did. I received email confirmation, a receipt and a credit note for the £1009 to use against a new booking. But when I tried to use the voucher, they told me it wasn't valid, i can't use it, they have no record of it or me paying for it. When I try to sort this out, I am told I must email via the website, so I do. I receive an email back asking me to call. So I do. When i call, I am told they cannot talk to me, i must email, so I do, and i get an email asking me to call. So i try again, and get told I must email... and round and round it goes. No one will speak to me, and every email receives a reply asking me to call. I sent them the receipt and the voucher but they refused to look at it saying they have no record of it and would never charge for a service fee.  End result; no flight, no refund. I will never ever book with Royal Air Maroc again under any circumstances.",10/10
"Not Verified|  As a frequent traveler, it should be disappointing to any travel related business to hear they are by far a customers worst experience. It's been nearly 1 year while I wait for ticket to be refunded, 1 year. Just a moment ago, I got off the phone during my once a week call to the Royal Air Maroc customer service, asking if perhaps this is the week they will do the right thing and give me my money back. Sadly, no this isn't the week. The nice lady on the phone informed me it's only been 3 months since receiving my refund claim and that due to covid, things can take a bit longer. Well, let's start with the fact that the airline never notified me of the flight cancellation, and made zero effort to communicate with me regarding the cancellation, or credit or a refund for 6 months after they cancelled the flight. Once I finally reached out via phone call and email, I waited another several months with no reply. At this point, obviously frustrated, I began calling back more frequently and was finally notified that my refund claim was filed incorrectly and I had to file it again. So now nearly 1 year later, while chatting with this nice lady on the phone, she tells me that since I've only waited 3 months since my claim was re-filed, I simply haven't waited long enough. How long is long enough? At this point, it's pretty clear that I was essentially robbed by this airline, and the most frustrating part is that every time I call asking when they will do the right thing, they just smile and keep lying more. Beyond awful service, companies like this should be pursued criminally. While I don't wish anyone to go through such experiences, one look at Royal Air Maroc online reviews and the story becomes clear. I'm not the first and won't be the last. But hopefully, through reviews such as this and those of others who've been cheated, people will eventually avoid, avoid, avoid, until Royal Air Maroc does right by its customers, or goes out of business. While I'm sure there are great staff working for this company and certain aspects of this review should probably be rated higher than a 0, I refuse to be treated this way any longer.",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  This flight was canceled in June of 2020 and I have sent numerous messages to the airline requesting a refund for this flight. I still have been unable to travel.to these destinations and the airline has not responded to any of my dozen or more requests for an answer. Terrible customer service and consideration for their customers and doing the right thing.,4/10
"Not Verified|  RAM use COVID 19 excuse to scam customers. If they can’t provide a service we paid for at lease refund back your client but do not promise to give a fake voucher or rebook and cancel flights whenever they want without letting you know and no proper answers or options. I was supposed to return to Dakar since May 22 and I am still here in Canada. 1 - Bad customer service, they never answer their phone here in Canada, I've tried 100 times a day over these past 5 days and nothing. 2 - Email reply, no accurate answers. 3 - do not provide you a flight option and the voucher that they are saying is valid for 18 months is fake which means you loose you money. Will never use them again and will not recommended to anybody I know.",1/10
✅Trip Verified| Casablanca to Athens. I have never dealt with such an unprofessional airline company and I do travel a lot. My flight was cancelled and replaced with Istanbul instead of Athens. I mean do they expect me to go there? They are not answering any of my calls or emails. I have filed 2 refund claims already.,1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  London to Banjul via Casablanca. Left Heathrow on time-full flight for Casablanca- evening meal served - tasty beef stew. Left Casablanca for Gambia - this time I chose chicken out of the same two options as the London flight. Cabin crew efficient and we landed on time. Return trip -another 737 - left at 2 am for Casablanca-plane full and on time-served a strange boxed meal/snack. Long wait at Casablanca - 6 hrs plus - as per schedule-airport is new, booked the lounge to wait, nothing special,but the airport itself was clean and bright. Last flight Casablanca to London delayed a bit because of storm Dennis, they served a hot meal which was OK. Landed late but safely having stacked at Heathrow waiting for storm - and other aircraft to land. Although all flights were 737-800 the vintage and layout of each was different, but legroom was ok- no individual screens on them. Not a bad series of flights - crews were seasoned and unobstrusive.",1/10
✅Trip Verified| Paris to Casablanca. As usual excellent flight with Royal Air Maroc. Planes getting old are still very comfortable. Full meal offered on this 2h30mn flight with choice of main dish and beverages including wine. Friendly Attendants friendly and will not hesitate to use RAM again.,7/10
"✅Trip Verified|  New York to Lisbon via Casablanca. I was surprised with the quality of the service. It is basic but super competitive. You get two free 2 luggages checked in for economy plus cabin luggage. The plane wasn't the cleanest, but I can live with that. Online entertainment was also good and I ordered a special meal and that was also free! Layover in Casablanca was an hour and smooth connection through security! I am happy to see RAM offering such as competitive service and much better value for money than all European airlines. I am going to be using them from now on coming to Europe. I can't afford the other European airlines, as they became so expensive and they make you pay for luggage separately.",9/10
"Not Verified|  Bologna to Casablanca. Pretty good airline! The legroom in the 737 is okay for a 3 hours flight. The food is really nice, perfectly cooked. This Boeing 737 features the traditional 3-3 seating configuration and a 2-2 premium economy class. I think this is Africa's best airline!",9/10
"✅Trip Verified| Casablanca to Lisbon. Our trip started in Miami with a final destination in Portugal, we had a stop in Casablanca where we changed planes and the luggage never got to Portugal. Instead, it stayed in Casablanca because of an airport strike from the employees of Royal Air Maroc. My bags along with the bags of many other people were left in Casablanca and I did not received my luggage until two days after. I had to go shopping for clothing and other things to be able to continue with my vacation. The customer service counter assured me that the money I spent would be reimbursed by the company. I tried to submit the papers the airline the day I left at the Royal Air Maroc counter in Portugal and they told me it had to be done in Casablanca because none in the Portugal counter could do it. When I tried to submit the papers to the counter in Casablanca they told me I needed to get outside the terminal and go to a special office because they could not do it either. I could not do it because I had to take the connecting flight to Miami and there was no time. When I arrived in Miami the counter for Royal Air Maroc there told me that they could not do it and that I needed to do it online. I had to call customer service multiple times and they never return my emails. At the end, after six months of wait time, they tell me I submitted the documents to late. All of that after they were the ones who did not answer owe despite me calling multiple times to check on the status of the claim. The only thing they said was that they had the documents and I needed to wait. At the end when I pressured to talk with the supervisor I received a day later a letter stating that I submitted the documents to late. This has been all around the worst airline I have traveled with in my life.",9/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Marrakech and the aircraft was terrible. Got to Marrakech in one piece and baggage made it. Vowed never to fly with Royal Air Maroc again, but as I had to return back to Casablanca the week after, I thought I would leave the return flight as is. Big mistake. I went to the airport for my 7am flight. People were screaming at the counter staff. The flight was cancelled. They offered to bus me to Casablanca. I turned this offer down as I would not have made my connecting flight. Royal Air Maroc told me I would get a refund on my ticket. I have made numerous calls to Royal Air Maroc, and they keep making excuses not to refund me. Staff do not speak English very well. Its been a nightmare. I filled in their online form to get a refund. To date no emails, no calls.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  New York to Dakar via Casablanca. Best quality price, modern aircraft, security of flights, client orientation of its agents and flight attendants. Royal Air Maroc has built a solid reputation to earn my business whenever I need a business trip or a vacation trip.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Marrakesh to London via Casablanca. When we arrived at the airport in Marrakesh our flight had been cancelled and we had a connecting flight in Casablanca. After waiting for several hours we were bussed to Casablanca leaving us no time to catch our flight. After going through security we were told at baggage drop it was too late. We pleaded with them as it wasn't our fault and were told to leave the line and find a manager which we refused to do as we had no time. We explained the situation to them and no one wanted to help. Eventually we got the go ahead and were told to run to the gate. There were several more checkpoints to go through with long cues and no help. We had to run from point to point and when asking for help were just ignored. The gate was at the far side of the airport so eventually arrived with a pocket full of cash that we couldn't spend in the duty free, dying of thirst as we couldn't stop to buy water and dripping wet through after all the running. All we needed was for one member of staff to be helpful and get us to the departure gate quickly through security and it wouldn't have been an issue. I have never come across such unhelpful staff.",4/10

"✅Trip Verified|  Marrakesh to Porto via Casablanca. The boarding in Marrakech was at the scheduled time, allowing the plane to take off about 25 minutes before the scheduled time and reach Casablanca almost at the time it should have left Marrakech. The crew was very efficient and attentive, which made the trip go smoothly. Despite the short trip, the plane had comfortable seats in the class in which I traveled (economic). On the Casablanca-Porto trip, the crew was equally friendly, helpful and attentive. There were newspapers of various kinds available, either in French or in Arabic. The seats were comfortable and a light but varied meal with fresh and tasty products was served. Overall the trip was great value for money and without any delay.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  The worst airline experience I have endured. I had 4 flights (connections through Casablanca to and from Europe) and all four were 3+ hours delayed. One of my return flights was cancelled without explanation 2 days before the start of my trip and little was down by way of creating a solution. As well, my bag was lost for the first 2 days of my trip which included a bridesmaids dress needed for a wedding. When I called multiple times to track the bag the airline had no idea where my bag was and said it would be returned within 2-21 days. I was informed that there were airport strikes in Casablanca and staff were messing with the customers as a form of striking. The employees lied to me and never offered explanations for the four delayed flights. They delayed my return so much that I missed my connection and had to unexpectedly stay the night in Casablanca. There were dozens of other passengers in the same predicament as I, all on differing flights.  I've filed a claim to receive compensation for the ordeal and received an automated message that someone will try to reply to my claim within 60 days.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Montreal to Beirut via Casablanca. Flights rescheduled for more than 5 hours so my arrival turned to be + 2days instead of +1 day. Both flights were delayed for more than 1,5 hours. Ground staff in Casablanca were rude and unfriendly to me.",1/10
Not Verified|  Casablanca to New York. We were sitting on the plane for 1.5 hrs without any communication from the captain or the crew. Upon arrival we saw the email sent with apologies which totally dumb. After arriving to New York we are waiting for the luggage for more then 1.5 hr.,5/10
"✅Trip Verified|  London to Bamako via Casablanca. I have just returned from Mali. Utterly shocking experience. Bags were missing for five days.

As I write, my baggage has gone missing again.",2/10
✅Trip Verified|  Algiers to Casablanca.  I booked a window seat and I want to have my window seat. When i arrived to Algiers airport they changed my seat and gave me an aisle seat. It is unacceptable as i paid a huge amount to avoid any kind of change. When i told them so they told me i should’ve arrived earlier. They sell business class tickets and change whatever they want!,1/10
"Not Verified|  Paris to Casablanca. Great Flight. First I was upgraded to business class. I has great attention from the cabin crew. The cabin of the Boeing 787-8 is very nice (even if the new 787-9 cabin is even better). Very good meal was served. Departure on time, arrival before time. Entertainment of good quality (could be richer of renewed more often, indeed as a frequent flyer with RAM, I have seen almost all movies I am interested in). Priority Luggage respected and delivered first. Very happy to be a gold frequent flyer of RAM.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  A pretty horrible experience. At Casablanca airport, aircraft parked at a remote location necessitating a bus ride in high heat to the plane. Seats extremely uncomfortable. No matter how you sit, there is no comfort. Ringing the FA call button is futile because no one ever came. Seat belt sign was turned on for an inordinately long time due to mild turbulence which had dissipated, but the sign was kept on. My young child needed to use the bathroom and crew kept sending him back to his seat. I finally went with him and told them that either he used the washroom or peed in his pants. A male FA told me that there was turbulence. I said that at the moment there wasn't any and that my son would use the washroom quickly. He said to me, ""how do you know there's no turbulence"". I answered, ""because I'm a pilot"".  He was unnecessarily curt and rude for no reason. One kid who must have been related to a crew member was sleeping in the closet with her legs protruding into the aisle. Completely unprofessional. Final gripe is that in Casablanca airport, you cannot use Morocan currency along with your credit card to get rid of your Moroccan money before leaving the country.",4/10
"Not Verified|  I was going from Washington to Malaga via Casablanca. First flight (RAM219) from Dulles to Casablanca was fine (I was able to purchase an upgrade to business at the counter with no problem). The second flight (RAM984) from Casablanca to Malaga was delayed. We were given very little information. “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” Followed by the same announcement 3 times. 1 hour later, we boarded a bus where we sat for 20 minutes. Got onto RAM984 – a propeller jet – which was very dirty, smelt of fumes, and had insects on the interior window. The plane sat on the runway for a long time, attempted to take off and failed, and returned to the airport. We were disembarked and waited another 2 hours for a new plane (with no information from rude staff). Flight from Casablanca to DC (RAM218): I wanted to purchase an upgrade. Was told that “we don’t have a machine.” (the woman in front of me had been overbooked and was given a free upgrade.) The gate area was very crowded. They made a boarding announcement and there was no organization (see photo). No one told passengers where to go or what zones to use. Then, we waited. We were given the same RAM-standard statement, “You will receive information in 10 minutes.” This happened 2 times. People were getting very angry. Ground staff called security who came and stood at the counter looking menacing. Boarded the plane. Stayed on the ground for more than an hour with no information from flight crew. We could see mechanics staring up at the underside of the wing, not reassuring and most of the passengers around me were fearful to fly. We finally took off 3 hours after flight time.  All the staff were rude and unhelpful. They didn’t speak. They turned their backs when I (and other passengers) asked questions. This whole experience has actually put me off of Morocco in general (and I wanted to travel there.)",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Washington to Casablanca. So our flight was supposed to leave at 10:00 pm Friday night. That tome comes and goes and it is not until after 11 pm that people are asking questions and getting no answers from the airline. Many people had connections they need to reach for various reasons that could have been met had the airline canceled the flight so that it would release reservations (our travel agent could not intervene because the flight was not declared canceled). Finally at 1:30 am we are informed that the flight is canceled and that they would take our contact info and reach out to us with more information later. Next morning we check our email and find out the new flight is scheduled for 12 noon. We rush back to the airport only to watch that time come and go with no explanations.  Good customer service would give updates, offer snack a to the kids / families, try to make some appeasements to all the sleep deprived travelers. I would not recommend this airline if I were traveling to this region again.",1/10

"✅Trip Verified|  Washington to Rome via Casablanca. I had a wonderful experience with this airline. I was slightly worried at first because I hadn't heard of the airline before and I saw a bunch of negative reviews on some websites. Also, I was wondering if this airline was so much cheaper than other flights because it would have really bad service - but that was not the case at all. We saved nearly $300 compared to other flights - even other non-direct flights. The flights were orderly and on-time. The staff was extremely friendly. The meals were actually really great! We had two meals on the longer leg of our flight, plus some snacks and beverages and even had one meal on the shorter 2ish hour flight from Casablanca to Rome (and vice versa). The entertainment was great too - awesome selection of movies. No issues with luggage. If looking for a great value flight without compromising too much comfort or service, this is a great airline to choose! I recommend it!",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Tangier to Amsterdam via Casablanca. Good service on board, the crew was very kind and did their best efforts to keep us satisfied. Plane was clean and the meal was good.

"✅Trip Verified|  Sao Paulo to Casablanca. I flew with them in April 2019. First, my original flight was cancelled, but then they only re-booked the first leg of my new booking. Then they lost my bag for 14 days.  They never answered any of my 4 emails. Their phone line were busy, never got to a person to talk to. The bag did show up May 6. My small personal bag that fit under the seat was not allowed, and was put in an overhead locker. They forgot my pre-ordered special meal, and breakfast was a piece of cheese on a bun. The inflight entertainment was very limited for me.",8/10
✅Trip Verified| Lagos to New York via Casablanca. The best airline experience I have had in a long time. I was skeptical about it and almost cancelled my flight after reading all the negative comments. The cabin crew were amazing and so polite. I can’t believe that when I got to New York a RAM official was waiting for me to come get my luggage. I really don’t have anything negative to say about this airline. I will recommend it to anyone. The secret is just be nice and people will be nice to you.,1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Washington. I had a plane change in Casablanca, Morocco. Our flight was delayed for 4 hours. The airlines said there was a baggage handler strike so it took awhile to take care of the luggage. We flew to our final destination which was Dulles International. After waiting over a half hour for luggage to come on to the carousal several other passengers including myself went to the luggage counter. We learned they did not load the luggage on the flight. They  gave us a form to fill out and it had a claim number spot. I asked for a claim number and he said to just call the number on the form. The next morning I called several numbers and received no help. They said I should have a claim number. I have spent numerous hours trying to get this problem fixed. I am going to travel back to Dulles which will cost me time and money.",10/10

"✅Trip Verified|  This is the most unprofessional airline I have dealt with. They are sending me emails everyday that either the flight time has changed, or the flight duration changed from 4 hours to 6 hours and they added an additional 50 min transit. They are changing the flight time and I have a layover, the layover time keeps getting shorter which would increase my risk of missing the second flight. I wouldn't have booked the flight if I knew I would have 2 transits and two 6-hour long flights. It's almost like a scam, attracting the customers to book the flight with a convenient flight time and duration and transits and then changing everything about it and refusing to give you a refund even after talking to them on the phone for 3 hours.",7/10

We reached the gate 30 minutes before boarding / 80 minutes before departure. We checked the flight information display board again, and the status shown was still the same ""gate closed"". The counter had been boarding passengers of other flights, but not AT217, since we reached the gate. We checked the board frequently and listened to announcements. There was never a single announcement about the flight. We checked with some ground staff and were told that the flight had departed.

"Not Verified|  New York to London via Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc have really made huge improvements. I just had a wonderful flight from New York to Casablanca. The plane was brand new, with a gorgeous interior. The seats in business were comfortable and lie-flat. Great crew, too - very lovely and proud of their company. Food was good and plentiful. The flight from Casablanca to London was on an older plane. The interior was a little beaten up, but still a lovely crew.

"✅Trip Verified|  Marrakech to Doha via Casablanca. Marrakech to Casablanca was fine.  All fine there, apart from having to walk across the tarmac and use steps to board. Same in Casablanca. Then the nightmare started. Separating of passengers connecting to international flights and those terminating in Casablanca was done outside the rear entry doors to the arrivals terminal. Passengers were jammed up against the side of the building standing in puddles of water waiting to have their passport and ticket examined by one of two officials who told them to go through either the international connections door or the domestic arrivals door. When another bus of disembarking passengers pulled up, there was no room for them to get off the bus and stand safely out of danger from passing airport vehicles. It was slow-moving mayhem. I’d imagine that people with tight connections missed their flights. I had a 3-hour layover, so once inside the terminal, I settled down to wait for AT216 to Doha. Luckily I checked the gate number several times as it was changed without notice or announcement shortly before boarding. Again we had to walk across the tarmac and climb stairs to board. Everything seemed fine as we taxied down the runway - then sat for about 20 minutes. Eventually an announcement was made that we were going back to the terminal, and we taxied back. A hoist/lift was wheeled out to the right-hand wing and several mechanics peered at a central flap which was elevated, and made calls on their mobile phones. So we sat for 3 hours 45 minutes! No announcements were made, no refreshments were given, nothing! Eventually I went to the galley to get some water and asked one of the male flight attendants what was happening. I was told there was a “technical services” problem, but that we should be leaving within 15 minutes. Well, that never happened. By that stage, people were getting tired and irritable. The two small children in front of me were screaming and crying. People started sleeping across three seats if they had a row to themselves. Eventually we were told to prepare for takeoff. The man behind me was still sleeping across three seats as we started taxiing down the runway, one of the flight attendants saw him, shook him awake and told him to buckle up. No safety briefing was given as we were just about to take off. As we took off, I had a clear view out the window of the wing and the flap which was still elevated.  We made up 45 minutes in the air, but I still had to run through Doha airport to make my connection to Perth. I would never fly RAM again. I felt less than confident on a 6-hour flight with them as in my opinion the technical services issue did not appear to have been rectified. We were not kept informed as to what the problem with the aircraft was nor given refreshments on board while we waited for the problem to be fixed.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Madrid to Casablanca. Excellent experience; this was my first time flying Royal Air Maroc, and I am very pleased with them.  The aircraft arrived to the gate on time, and we boarded and departed on time. The seats were clean and comfortable. One of the things that very pleasantly surprised me is that, despite the fact that this flight is barely 1.5 hours, the flight attendants served a delicious, hot meal, complete with beverages. You'll never get anything more than peanuts or pretzels on a domestic flight in America, so imagine my surprise! The flight attendants were polite, friendly, and courteous. The in-flight entertainment was displayed on drop-down screens (old school Charlie Chaplin, so it was family friendly), but I wasn't going to complain about the lack of entertainment options on this short of a flight. You can also access WiFi on your phone, so there are definitely some options. The plane ride was smooth, and there were no issues with debarking and picking up my luggage. Overall, I am very pleased with my experience, and highly recommend my family, friends, and others to fly with Royal Air Maroc. I will definitely be flying with them in the near future.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Barcelona. RAM has made a lot of effort in recent years. It is  the fault of other operators at airports, such as the delivery of luggage, delays etc. So let us be indulgent at times, and let's not say that bad things. You also have to share the positive, which will push the teams in place to do much more work.FR: RAM a fait beaucoup d'efforts ces dernières années avec peu de moyens et une concurrence de plus en plus féroce. Et ce qu'il faut savoir, c'est qu'on responsabilise souvent la compagnie, alors que c'est aussi la faute des autres opérateurs dans les aéroports, tels que la livraison de bagages, les retards etc... Soyons donc indulgents par moments, et ne disons pas que les mauvaises choses. Il faut savoir partager aussi le positif, ce qui poussera les équipes en place à faire beaucoup plus d'éfforts.",4/10
"✅Trip Verified| La compagnie a nettement amélioré ses services à terre et en cabine. L'enregistrement est fluide est disponible à n'importe quel moment. Les bagages arrivent à temps et intacts ! J'aime aussi leur programme de fidélisation : des courriels interessants, des messages personnalisés, un suivi régulier, des billets bonus et autres avantages. Vraiment Bravo! - The company has significantly improved its services on land and in the cabin. Fluent recording is available at any time. The luggage arrives on time and intact! I also like their loyalty program: interesting emails, personalized messages, regular follow-up, bonus tickets and other benefits. Congratulations!",8/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Montreal to Casablanca in April 2017. The flight was pretty good. I have no complains regarding that. My issue started when I was refused boarding on my way back. The reason that was given to me was that the flight was overbooked and they looked for volunteers to take the flight the next day. As a solo traveller I agreed to collaborate to help out, even though I was a losing a day of work. I was given a paper with which I would have to claim a compensation when I would be back in my town. When I began the process back at home, it seemed to go well at first. They answered e-mails and they had to reimburse me 75% of my ticket cost. Then they made me give them my bank details and then I never heard from them again. I could not reach them or the line would be cut as when you call them, you're probably redirected to Morocco itself. It is very hard to hear and understand. The representatives are not very nice or patient either. I was directed to the local office in Montreal where the only lady working there never returned my messages and she is never there. I simply gave up after having wasted quite a bit of time and effort. So, I never received the money and now I never want to fly with this company again. I am a frequent traveller and I never complain. This time, I felt I had to share my unique bad experience with an air company. I have never seen this before.",9/10

"✅Trip Verified|  I had a flight 29th September from Casablanca to Gran Canaria. I chose this airline because it is only one direct flight from Maroc to Canarian islands. Royal air Maroc left my luggage in Casablanca (the same situation for more than 5 people from this flight). I could not connect to this company to check the delivery status of my luggage because the contact center is always busy as well as connection by an email. Moreover Iberia try to connect with Royal Maroc through internal system and ask about the lost luggage, so no feedback was received. Overall my holiday on Gran Canaria is damaged by this situation because all my things and essential are in luggage. I do not recommend to fly by Royal Air Maroc. The customer service is awful.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified| This was my first time making use of Royal Air Maroc and I would say it was my worst experience since I started flying 20 years ago. The cabin crew staff are really nice and they try to make the most of the situation, but the ground staff at Casablanca got angry at me for asking why my connection to Monrovia was delayed by 3 hours. The flight from Luanda to Casablanca offered 2 meals which both consisted of a dry roll with a slice of processed cheese, a yogurt and a cold deformed muffin. The food to Monrovia was much better and of a much better quality. Also, the plane from Luanda was old and needed maintenance, and sitting close to the toilet with the broken door meant I could smell everything. I then had a 12 hour layover in Casablanca, but the transit hotel was full from when I landed at 10am which meant I had sit on the airport for 12 hours with no place to just relax. The flight to Monrovia was then delayed by 3 hours and staff not once told us why but rather got angry and argued with us for asking why it was delayed. Only after some passenger vowed to shutdown the airport if our flight does not leave then ground staff appeared and angrily told us to board the plane. The service of ground staff is disgusting and they treat passenger like they are a nuisance to them rather than customers. They are rude, have no patience and just could not care about making the experience comfortable for passengers.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Nairobi. This flight was my worst in 40 years of travel. I was notified one hour before flight time of changes - via email. Royal Air Maroc did not properly attach my travel agency booking. When I arrived at the ticket sales counter for assistance, there was a fury of angry female agents barking at customers in three languages. They sounded like dogs whose collars were too tight. Not a drop of politeness: angry, dismissive, indifferent and incompetent - without a drop of empathy for a traveler earring on a two day journey. Only a government sponsored employee could get away with this egregious deportment. I kept quiet - dodging the continuous barrage of daggers from these angry “ladies”. My only regret was that I didn’t video these proceedings - but knew these women would make sure I never got to my destination. As a medical doctor, I am baffled at this hostility. Eventually, a male supervisor was summoned to this fiasco - from his non-verbals, he was frustrated, but assuaged the employees. Was it necessary? I will not follow through with a repeat. Next time, Air France.",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Milan. Staff on board very helpful and attentive to the needs of passengers. I will certainly continue to use this company for my work / personal travels.

"Not Verified|  Dakar to Casablanca. I am very happy with my trips with Royal Air Maroc. It is the company with which I travel for more than 10 years. I never had a problem with check-in or luggage, all my trips were fantastic. At the boarding the staff was very hospitable with the passengers. On board, the crew was welcoming, the flight was very pleasant.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Rabat to London in March 2018. Plane delayed, with no explanation from ground crew. I believe crew were smoking in the flight deck and the smell of cigarette in the cabin.  Many passengers wanted to have their carry-ons right above their heads no matter how crowded the plane was, so many of them were making a scene when it was full. To make matters worse, some economy passengers even put their carry-ons in the business class overhead compartments, and the crew couldn't care less when business class passengers couldn't find a spot for their own.  On the return flight from London we had to wait for an ""important"" passenger before we could pushback. Whenever I can, I fly Lufthansa, Emirates, Qatar depending on where I'm going. You may find a flight that ends being okay, so if you're okay taking that chance, sure.",4/10

"✅Trip Verified|  I had read bad reviews about Royal Air Maroc so I was pleasantly surprised! The flight from Manchester to Accra via Casablanca was fine, the food was good, there was entertainment available if you had a device to link to their wifi and all of my luggage made it! The security check at Casablanca was tense and chaotic but that is not the airlines fault. Definitely recommended!",9/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Stockholm to Marrakech via Casablanca. They cancelled the flight last October with two days notice, without offering even a reason or trying to rebook me on another flight. Customer care was initially trying to help, but unable to do so. They agreed to repay the ticket price (this was 9 months ago) but they haven't paid a dime. Every time I call them they promise to repay the money, but now they just hang up when I describe my issue. I finally managed to buy the last business class ticket with another airline going to Morocco, but I still had my Royal Air Maroc tickets when leaving Morocco. That flight was not luckily not cancelled, but seat was dirty and ground staff careless.",7/10
"Not Verified|  They lost my bag. Call center was busy all the time, unable to contact them. No priority boarding row for business class in Casablanca: stood in line for 30min at the gate and 10min on the stairs of the plane. When asked for explanation ignored by ground personel! Seat was filthy, tray table dirty, not cleaned from previous flight leaving Casablanca.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Amsterdam. I travel a lot with Royal air Maroc. And I can see that every flight is quite different but it's getting way better than before. My flight from casablanca to Amsterdam was on of the best flight ever. The crew was professional, the seats were big and the space for feet were all like an exit. It was so confortable and I had the best 3 hours flight ever. The meal was great , the plane was clean, the crew was helpful and I just enjoyed it.",2/10
"✅Trip Verified|  On my flight from Marrakech to Gatwick via Casablanca the flight was consistently delayed and we were given no information - the attendants at the gate either ran away from passengers who were asking what was happening, were rude to them, or  ignored us. They assured us we would not miss our connecting flight to London, as soon as we arrived in Casablanca we were met with zero help, and told all flights to London had left for the day. Again, desk agents were incredibly rude, ignoring people begging for help. I am 300+ pounds out of pocket paying for their mistakes. They refuse to get in touch with me via email or any other means. They ignore their customers. Never fly them! Not a single apology was offered to me.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified| Flew Paris to Rabat. I always enjoy flying with Royal Air Maroc, most of the time there is no delay, the cabin staff service is really good and the food is not bad. The only thing that needs improvement is the new app Sky-Ram (it need more music / more movies / newspapers / more games). Safar Flyer program is also really interesting. I strongly recommend flying with Royal Air Maroc!",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Paris. Flight arrived 5 minutes in advance to Paris. The entertainment service is not working for movies and music is very poor (only 2 choices). Cleanliness of the plane is ok Plane was not full. This flight is less expensive than the one of Monday.,9/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Istanbul to Casablanca. Flight was punctual. Information provided before boarding and during flight regarding departure time, arrival time, flight conditions were correct and reliable. Meals and beverages served are varied and balanced.

The SKYRAM service is really amazing, you can watch films, listen to music and play games directly on your cell phone or iPad.",8/10
✅Trip Verified|  Cairo to Casablanca. We had a flight delayed due to plane problems which is understandable. The airline was very poor in communicating what was happening. The delay was for approximately 26 hours. The airline supplied lunch but no further meals. They tried to board us around midnight but the pilot said no as the fault had not been fixed. When we finally arrived in Casablanca they had left half the bags behind. We had to travel to the airport the next day at our own time and expense to get the bags back. We were out of pocket for accommodation due to the delay: cancelled flight. They airline after many weeks agreed to reimburse me for the accommodation. They still have not and will not respond to any emails. I have a letter signed by the airline manager in Cairo stating the flight cancellation and a copy of the email from the airline stating they will reimburse me for the accommodation. We have supplied them will all of the information they require and have keep all email correspondence.,4/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Doha. The experience was great. Staff, food service and boarding was great, the only problem was that no one is cleaning the toilet during the flight of 7h 40. The Royal Air Maroc services changes compared to before. The professional way they did is goo .",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Rio de Janeiro to London via Casablanca, We were supposed to fly out of Rio on Friday 20th. Once we were all checked in we went to the gate only to be told that there would be a 30 minute delay. This 30 minute delay turned into 90 minutes, with the airline finally cancelling the flight. The transportation from the airport to the hotel was a shamble.  So people like us opted just to take a cab to the suggested hotel. Once there we discover after waiting for an hour that they did not have enough rooms for everyone. So we took a second cab to the next suggested hotel. We got a room there. The following day evening was picked up by coach and we were told that our flight would be at 6pm. Again, all checked in, went to the gate and they repeated the same as the night before, cancelled our flight. Why bring everyone to the airport only to cancel their flight again. Everyone was clearly and justifiably annoyed. They had hardly any staff and no sense of direction. When asked if we would be refunded our money if we book with another airline we could not get a clear answer from them. The second nights hotel was awful, some nasty place in town. We still have no idea if we will be flying today or not. This has to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. RAM does not have a office, a desk or even any representatives in Rio. So if you get stuck then you are pretty much on your own. Also, there website for handling claims is an absolute joke. If we pay for our own tickets back to London it will cost £1200 each with no guarantee of us ever seeing a penny of that again.",8/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Booked a flight from Berlin to Marrakesh via Munich. By the time we arrived in Munich we found out that our flight to Marrakesh was cancelled and after contacting customer support and calling the hotline, we got informed that we will fly via Casablanca, arriving six hours later than planned in Marrakesh. When we finally arrived in Marrakesh around midnight, we were waiting for our luggage to arrive. Unfortunately it didn't, meaning another one hour wait at the lost and found desk with several other passengers. That means we had to book a hotel and try to collect our luggage and car the next day. This didn't work either, no traces of our luggage until someone in Germany helped us, by calling several airports (luggage was then found in Paris). We spent four days without our stuff, had to buy some new clothing and hygiene products, which never got paid back by the airline and no compensation payment has been paid til today.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Casablanca to Paris. This morning I missed my flight with a different airline (my fault) departing Casablanca. For the next 3 hours I was running around the airport trying to find my bag - as the airport staff are impossible to deal with. I found a 2nd flight with Royal Air Maroc and then on 4 separate occasions Royal Air Maroc staff were unbelievably helpful! If it wasn’t for them, I never would have found my bag and I would have missed a 2nd flight. I can’t thank them enough they helped me with difficult customs staff, escorted me through the airport and hassled baggage handlers. I have flown with them several times but this was something special. Well done Royal Air Maroc! Highly recommend!",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  Accra to New York via Casablanca. Boarding and disembarking formalities well organized. Departures and arrivals on time. Cabin crew very courteous.

Flight announcement at the airport in Casablanca is not audible at all. Less seats for passengers on transit.,10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Luanda to Lisbon via Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc is my favorite airline, the crew are friendly there uniforms are good and the aircraft is clean.

✅Trip Verified| Flew Royal Air Maroc from Montreal to Geneva via Casablanca. Totally fine experience. Nothing remarkably good or bad about the trip.

✅Trip Verified|  There was a delay for departure from Rio. We missed our flight in Casablanca and they booked us another ticket for the next day.

We finally booked on our own the ticket for the same day. Never book with this airline again.,8/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Moscow to Marrakech via Casablanca. I must say that this airline is very nice, and I have no hesitations using it in the future. Online service is a bit weird, because it is literally impossible to select your seats properly, the system selects them for you, and there seems to be no logic behind the selection. Moscow to Casablanca (5 hours 30 minutes, on-time) Check-in was a breeze. The flight was operated by a B737-800 with a nice modern interior and mood lighting, and we were randomly assigned emergency exit seats - which has tons of legroom and very comfortable old-fashioned thick seat profile. Pillows and blankets were waiting on every seat - a rare sight! The flight was half-empty, so there was lots of room to spread out for everyone. The staff were polite and quite friendly, but it took them almost an hour and a half to start the service - which is awfully long for a daytime flight. The meals - full trays with salads, desserts, bread and a hot main dish - were delicious, especially the pre-ordered seafood meal, even if the presentation was a bit lacking. They also had complimentary Moroccan wine in small glass bottles, which was very classy, as well as great in taste. Surprisingly, they served one more meal around an hour before landing, which consisted of two large sandwiches for each passenger. This is the first time I felt so full after the economy class flight, and that's a very rare thing nowadays. The plane had no personal entertainment or power ports, so consider bringing your own. Marrakech-Casablanca (40 minutes, on-time). Check-in was very fast once again, but surprisingly not even the airport employee could not change the assigned seats, since she apparently did not have access to the system, and I have been assigned a seat in different row that of my travel companion. The flight on an ATR72 was almost empty, with only 11 passengers, and the ATR72 was the most comfortable plane of its category I ever took. A lot of legroom once again. This flight features zero service, not even drinks, which I found surprising - they could have at least provided water. Not a big deal, considering it's just a short hop. Casablanca airport is not a great place for transit, but not the worst one I've been to (Rome Fiumicino, I'm looking at you). Long lines and a sense of chaos everywhere, but the waiting times were actually very small. Casablanca-Moscow (5 hours 40 minutes). The flight to Moscow was operated by a similar B737-800 and was jam-packed with transit passengers from Nigeria, and the boarding was extremely chaotic and disorganized, with the staff checking almost everyone for explosives right before boarding. Once onboard, I tried to ask a flight attendant for a seat change, but he told us to wait until after take-off. I asked another one, and this time the attendant was extremely nice and helpful, and even arranged for me to reseat in another regular economy row to me more comfortable. Then we switched seats with some fellow passengers, that have also been separated by the weird Royal Air Maroc seat assignment system, and ended up in the bulkhead row. The service was similar to the first flight, but this time they even provided amenity kits - with eye masks and socks, and the quality of the kit itself was better than that of Singapore Airlines, for example. The food and wine were great again, and the luggage arrived safely.",1/10
✅Trip Verified|  Marrakech to Montreal via Casablanca. I enjoyed the flight. the personal tv screen was big enough and I watched 2 of the latest movies. The food was excellent. The service was great. My seat was big and comfortable. The big advantage with this airline is that you are allowed two checked in luggage. Also on this new plane there was plenty room for hand luggage in the overhead cabinets.,4/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Lisbon to Doha via Casablanca. It was not the first time I'm traveling with RAM, until now everything it's average. My only concern was when I arrive in Casablanca, the flight was late from Lisbon, and we only had like 35 minutes for the other flight. They inform clients we have time to be there on time and more help from security in the luggage verification (I need to ask to let me pass) and the police needs to understand English. Crew in the gate more polite and respectful and don't keep any passport in the gate table without any explanation.",10/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Tenerife to Casablanca. Our baggage arrived one day later, because there was not enough space in the airplane. But we didn't get any information about this. Not on the departure Airport and neither on the target Airport. We had to go to the lost Baggage counter to get this information. It's really frustrated, because have to stay one day longer in Casablanca. The baggage was not delivered to the hotel. But that's not my major problem with it, it's more the communication. The airplane looks modern but the seat pocket was dirty. There was the drinks and food on the plane. A small meal. It contains a muffin and sandwich. But better they skip this sandwich in the future.",6/10
"✅Trip Verified| Flew Royal Air Maroc from Munich to Casablanca. Chaos to say the least. They lost my luggage and 4 days later I can't get an answer on the phone as to what is going on.

"✅Trip Verified|  Freetown to Marrakech via Casablanca. The aircraft, service and the food was all very average. Flights left on time, but that's about the only positive thing I have to say. The planes seemed very old. Service was perfunctory and disinterested. Food was poor - real old-school airplane food meals; stale bread, tasteless mains. The tickets were very expensive, but that's a given for anything departing from Sierra Leone. I would not choose to fly them again.",1/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Tenerife to Marrakesh via Casablanca. The service is average. The airline provided a snack on the 2h 40m flight but orange juice was the worst I have tasted. The main complaint is a lack of airport safety. Before the domestic flight, the Airport security staff did not check my luggage. They ran my bag through x-ray without me taking out the notebook, camera, 5 small bottles of liquid and a 0.5-liter bottle of water attached to the side of my bag. On the domestic flight, they also have travelers who have already passed clearance on the border with others. Everybody has to go through passport control on arrival.",5/10
"✅Trip Verified| London  to Cotonou via Casablanca. Boarding was smooth, and on time. Flight was pleasant. Arrival into Casablanca had to deplane and board next flight, had to go thru security which was slow as connection was 1 hr later. Just made it to departure gate when found fight delayed. Took off not very late and landed in Cotonou and found my checked in bag was missing. Filed a missing bag info, was informed that the next day my bag was in Casablanca and would arrive 2 days later. However had to leave Cotonou to Istanbul on business and could not collect it. Had given them address to my hometown for shipping it but after repeated emails no response and no bag.",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  Nice to Washington via Casablanca. Flight staff and airport not worthy of Boeing 787. Returning from 3 weeks in France we chose to fly from Nice to Casablanca and on to Washington DC on Royal Air Maroc because the second leg was on the Boeing 787. Boarding in Casablanca was confused, disorganized and perilous. As has become customary for international passengers flying to the U.S. we had a second security check at the gate where we were fully patted down and carry-on inspected. While the males were whisked through by two males, there were no female security guards. All the females had to wait nearly an hour before a female started their pat down and a similar delay until the entire line was cleared. Meanwhile the men and boys did not directly board the plane from our main terminal gate. No! We, and subsequently the women and female children had to descend three flights of dirty ill lit stairs, get on a bus and go to the old original terminal, climb three full flights of stairs to the gate and then board the plane. At check-in I had asked for my pre-ordered wheelchair as I've very limited eyesight (legally blind) and Vertigo and was told a wheelchair was not available. Stairs are a real challenge especially without my wife alongside and dependent on filthy banisters and just my cane. Our aisle seats on Boeing’s newest aircraft were comfortable, the coach class seat pitch was the usual 30” we find on most airlines. We had expected Moroccan style cuisine we experienced on an earlier trip to Morocco, but we received the same food Air Maroc served on the first leg from Nice. The cabin service was erratic and staff not at all customer-friendly. Midway through the flight we found that the rest rooms had no toilet paper, no towels, no Kleenex, and the refuse bin was overflowing. A few minutes later the captain came up the aisle going to the galley so I buttonholed him, described the conditions and stated that the cabin crew were disrespecting a new aircraft. The captain took a peek then stormed off. Shortly two male stewards rushed up with their arms loaded with paper products. They seem satisfied with their mediocrity and deficiencies and there's slim chances of improving. Never again on Air Maroc or a transit stop in Casablanca!",3/10
"✅Trip Verified|  London to Ouarzazate return via Casablanca, both way basic economy class. I went to Heathrow, through check in quickly, we took off on time, onboard staff very pleasant, tasty warm food onboard along with drinks, no long lines at Casablanca everything smooth and easy, transfer on time and I  arrived to my final destination 20 min earlier. Same with my return journey. I do not know if I was just lucky person (4 times in one trip) but honestly I say I would chose them million times more over Ryanair. Seats much more comfortable, staff very polite.  So, to all you guys awaiting your trip with RAM, sleep well! Nothing to worry about. I think they were getting very unfair reviews.",2/10
"✅Verified Review|  Casablanca to Yaoundé via Douala. A very pleasant experience in a modern and clean aircraft. A little chaotic boarding as many people were reseated during the process. As the last rows of the cabin were free, people reseated themselves after boarding, resulting in a free seat next to me. Smooth flight, attentive staff and OK food. No hesitation to fly again in the future.",10/10
"✅Verified Review|  Gran Canaria to Casablanca. I thought Royal air Maroc had improved its services but from my recent experience, RAM unfortunately has not. We had about 2 hours delay on outward flight, while RAM on return flight decided to cancel one of its route from Canarias. We were informed of this cancellation while we were already at the airport (so 3 hours before departure) : although we bought a Las Palmas - Casablanca direct flight ticket, we had now to wait for the Tenerife plane to come to Las Palmas. I was with my family : my wife, 6 years old child and a 1 year old baby. While we were waiting our turn, the agent at check in decided to call some identified persons (that were behind us in the queue) to give them priority in registration. These people were persons in transit (their end destination was not Casablanca). After that the agent informed us that the plane was now full and that we had to wait for the day after to fly back home. I tried in vain to get someone from RAM Company to come and find solution. No one came and at the end we had to accept the situation. I think that these practices should be condemned.",4/10
"✅Verified Review|  Stockholm to Dakhla via Casablanca. The flight itself ok, but they lost my kitesurfing gear, and now have been waiting for any information for 4 days. 1/3 of the kitesurfing holiday is gone, when visiting the airport there's no one working, customer service cant do anything  without some claim number that I haven't been given, no one answers the phone, no one speaks english. There has been 2 flights a day, so 8 flights and still I don't get my stuff?",1/10
"✅Verified Review| Flew from Agadir to Madrid via Casablance, hadn't used Royal Air Maroc before. Check in / boarding in Agadir was fine and bag was checked all they way through to Madrid - I had to book business class as I needed a fully changeable ticket, crew seemed nice enough when boarding - but that's about as much as I saw of them. I was surprised that for the fare involved on the Agadir - Casablanca sector there was not even the offer of a glass of water, the curtain to the galley was across the whole time with the smell of food wafting through (crew meals obviously) disappointing service to be honest. The transfer at Casablanca was fine / the crew on the Casablanca - Madrid sector were very pleasant, the cabin lay-out was proper ""first class"" style seating plenty of leg room, magazines offered before take-off with pre-flight water or juice. As the flight was only 1 hour and 15, I was given a meal tray which had a hot beef shawarma with fruit salad and Mango mousse cake. It was delicious to be honest and a hot towel service after. The only thing I found really odd on this sector was there were no announcements made in English at all only French and Arabic (the safety demo was a video in English and Arabic) there were a few USA passengers on board also and we had to ask the crew what the announcements were about which I found odd. On the previous sector Agadir / Casablanca all the announcements were made in French / Arabic / English so I'm unsure as to what they were up to as the majority of passengers on the Casablanca / Madrid were Spanish or English speaking. Overall RAM is a good airline but they would need to get their on-board service aligned a bit better .",2/10
"✅Verified Review|  Bologna to Beirut via Casablanca. It was a transit travel, and the airline should have booked an hotel inside the airport to stay this night. So, they gave me the hotel booking and when I got there, the hotel was fully booked. I returned to them, and after waiting a lot of time and many people came having the same problem, they took us by bus inside the airport to a lounge that contains sofas, and they told us that we should stay there till the next day. This lounge was not finished (it was not fully equipped and a smell of paint), and it does not have any privacy, in which all the sofas are beside each other. It was really a very insulting experience.",6/10
"✅Verified Review|  We booked from Brussels to Nairobi via Casablanca and we got the tickets. There it stated we had a stopover at Casablanca (1hour and 10 minutes lay over).  When we tried to check in online the evening before, we could only check in from Brussels to Casablanca. No changes in flight hours where shown. When arriving in Brussels airport, 3 hours in advance, they only could check us in for the flight to Casablanca. The personel of RAM told us this was normal procedure and once we would arrive in Casablanca, we would receive our next boarding pass for the plane to Nairobi. Once arrived in Casablanca (on time, still had more than an hour to get on the other plane), the personel of RAM showed us where to obtain our other boarding passes. At this desk they suddenly told us 'that plane left more than an hour early!'. So, as our first plane was landing, the other one was already taking off! Nobody notified us, not online, no e-mail, message. We were speechless and desperate. Together with an American couple (who also booked a direct ticket from Brussels to Nairobi), the personel told us it was no problem, they would refund our flight and that we would have to take the next flight, 2 days later! This was not an option for us, because we already booked a safari with driver and airport pick up, all planned from the moment we would arrive in Nairobi. After 3 hours, they told us to come fast, because there was a flight to Cameroon we should be on. Then, from Cameroon, we would have to take a flight to Nairobi. Instead of arriving at 2am, we would arrive at 8 pm (losing an entire day of safari and hotel, but still less worse than losing 2). They told us it was safe to transfer at Douala. Once arrived in Douala (after a night flight with stopover in Yaoundé), at 4am, the border control would not let us enter (because we had no ticket and visa), they called the police, who took our pasports and we had to sleep outside the police departement at the airport! At 8am the office of Kenya Airways opened (where we had to check in for the flight). But RAM had put us 2 on wrong seats! The others could board, but not the two of us. After 2 hoffiric hours their personel managed to get us on a flight to Nairobi. Late in the evening we arrived in Nairobi, lost the money of our hotel, lost the money of our safari. The return flight from Nairobi to Paris was a disaster as well! In Nairobi, the personel told us we would have to take our luggage in Casablanca (since we were booked to spend one day at a hotel in Casablanca). In Casablance they told us they could not obtain our luggage. We had no spare clothes, toothbrush, shampoo. Next day, arriving in Paris, one of our bags was missing. After 2 hours of waiting, they found our bag, who was shipped in another plane.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Marrakech to Paris. The airline operates the exact route for two earlier flights on same day. Yesterday, we spoke with the Morocco reps asking how we put ourselves on standby for the flights. They said they cannot do it, and we must go to airport and ask gate agents. We wake up at 5:30am to go to airport. First rep at the RAM counter says both morning flights are fully booked, there's nothing they can do (but they were still selling tickets online for this flight!) I go the the rep adjacent to the first agent. She says there's plenty of space but they only handle check in at this counter, so we must call RAM - which we'd already done and were instructed to go to airport. We nevertheless call RAM again, this time an English speaking number, and the guy says that he cannot change over the phone, only the agents at the airport can do that. They will give you the run around on the most basic customer requests.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Casablanca to Marrakech. I've never seen such chaos at the airport, and there was no flight delay or anything wrong. Only two people checking a long line of people in - everyone was unclear where to go and when I asked I was given different answers from each Royal Air Maroc desk I went to. Flights are cheap so if you really need to save money and they are going to a destination you need to cross your fingers. The flight attendants were very pleasant though!",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Nouakchott to Casablanca, the level of service was quite low. No preferential check in for business class or preferential boarding. It was a internal african route, so probably the carrier would not use the best plane in the fleet, but the Boeing 737-800 was not very clean, and the level of service was average. No entertainment, but the flight is only about 3 hrs). The food was ok.",4/10
"✅Verified Review| We were booked to fly on Royal Air Maroc flight AT587 from Casablanca to Sal Island (SID) July 14, 2017. The flight had a stop over at Praia Island. As we were boarding the ground crew asked any passengers who were flying to Sal Island to step aside and wait. All the passengers to Praia Island boarded as per usual. We were offered no information or explanation, but we started getting worried as the time for the plane to depart drew near. Sure enough the time came and we saw the plane leave. Still no explanation. There were 7 of us. Tried to get some answers from ground crew but they were either unwilling to tell us or were clueless themselves. Eventually we were told that the connecting flight was canceled and we will need to come the next day to see if we can get on another flight. There were no apologies, no explanation. I later did some talking and some research myself and found out the connection flight was canceled because there were only 7 of us and thus not profitable for the airline. Horrible experience.",4/10
"✅Verified Review|  My flight from Sao Paulo to Gatwick via Casablanca on 5th July was cancelled at roughly 48 hours notice. There was an offer to reschedule my flight for later in the week but was useless as I had to be in the UK before their offered replacement. I managed to book a flight with another airline. I e-mailed saying I expected a full refund. I received a phone call that was poorly connected and I couldn't understand what was being said. I told RAM I wanted a refund as I had made other plans. The man hung up and I received an e-mail with a re organised flight, different to the one offered in the original e-mail, that still proved useless for my travel needs. I replied again to that e-mail stating I wanted a refund. I am waiting for a response. Their customer service is appalling and their lack of organisation is apparent through poor communication and trying to just book you onto alternatives without consulting you first.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Amsterdam to Casablanca. I flew with a group of fellow travellers from Amsterdam to Bamako in Mali with a stopover in Casablanca. Royal Air Maroc told half the group to receive their boarding passes for Bamako in Casablanca. They did not, because to aircraft was severely overbooked by returning Muslims from the pilgrimage to Mecca. With trepidation, I booked Amsterdam to Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. Without any notice, Royal Air Maroc cancelled my return flight and we were booked on an earlier flight. This made me put Royal Air Maroc on 24-hour death row watch with the help of from Amadeus. Amadeus informed me that my return flight was reschedules again. 49 hours before the flight I tried to get my boarding passes, but the web check-in was still closed. Exactly 48 hours before the flight I started the web check-in to print the boarding passes, finding out that only three seats were still available on this flight. All others were already allocated to other passengers before the web check-in even opened. My wife and I could not sit together. I called Royal Air Maroc but they confirmed this was not possible to be allocated a seat before the web check-in. Sure. At the airport check-in counter, I asked to sit together. The staff member asked her colleague to release seats with an ""R"" for us. Her reply: no. At the gate, we asked it again and promptly Royal Air Maroc gave us seats next to each other. On board the 737 we noticed about 20-30 seats empty. Very strange. We asked ourselves if there is any link between the departments of reservation and operation. The flight went well and the service was good. Amadeus informed us in time that our return flight would depart 1 hour earlier, due to the temporary Ramadan time zone shift. Royal Air Maroc did sent an email message, when we were in mid-flight. The flight was on time, the service was good and the meals tasted nice. Conclusion: in the last 60 years, Royal Air Maroc has learned to fly aircrafts very well. In the new departments of internet reservation & communication, Royal Air Maroc is still struggling as a newbie.",4/10
"✅Verified Review|  Lisbon to Doha via Casablanca. I sent two complaints to RAM and I have not heard a thing back. Our journey out of Doha was fine and there were no issues; once we got onto the aircraft we both slept most of the way. The return journey from Casablanca to Doha was however a little different and disappointing. The aircraft was dirty and the staff inattentive. I pressed my call button a number of times; staff did not come and were sat around at the back. Because of this, I got up and went to the back of the aircraft myself where I found staff disregarded me and other customers! Eventually a young man asked me what I wanted and I requested a glass of white and red wine. He immediately dismissed me and said he would have to check at the front of the aircraft and would bring the wine to me! I waited a long time. In the end, I went back to the rear and asked again - I chose the only steward who had been polite so far throughout the journey (who was the most accommodating on the flight) he asked me what I would like. I replied that I would like two glasses of wine: one for myself and one for my husband. He grudgingly said he would bring it to me in cups!",4/10
"✅Verified Review| I have flown with Royal Air Maroc over 10 times within the last few months. Always London - Abidjan - London and always with a stopover in Casablanca. They are consistently the keenest pricing on this route and with RAM each time you make a booking it is like rolling the dice. The experience on the European facing routes is consistently good and the aircraft modern. On the African side the experience tends to be less good but still OK. Where the element of chance comes in is that if anything goes wrong with your connection in Casablanca then these guys just melt away - like snow in the Sahara - and you will be left without information, help, or any sense that there is any coherent policy for sorting things out. I had one horrendous experience when Heathrow was fogbound and the lack of information meant that when the flight eventually too off it did so without about 20 passengers. To their credit they did eventually get us to Heathrow later the same day to be reunited with our luggage which had gone on without us. Casablanca airport is just about OK for a short stopover - insufficient seating, lousy PA but fairly modern. Service on planes is adequate and they staff reasonably friendly.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Amsterdam to Marrakech return via Casablanca. More than 3 hours of delay on the first flight, reason given: pilot was sick, then talks about a strike (no evidence anywhere of a strike, they said this to discourage people demanding their money back).  Missed corresponding flight in Casablanca. Only 3 people to help hundreds of stranded passengers to check for other flights or solutions. One person available to help for accomodation (a basic right when stranded for the night) for hundreds of passengers. This person is then clearly stalling the whole time and telling people: ""All of the hotels nearby are full. It's not worth it to book a hotel in town if you have a flight in 7 hours, etc"". Finally we give up. We stay the night in a cold airport. Next morning: finally the connecting flight. Upon arrival we notice our luggage was not on the flight (even after checking with several different people at Casablanca airport that the luggage would come). Nobody from Royal Air Maroc at Marrakesh airport. After an hour of searching somebody could verify our luggage was still somewhere in the system. It arrived at night, we had to take a taxi and lose more time. Finally,  when checking in for the flight back home we were told that our booking for the flight got automatically cancelled because there were problems with one or more previous flights. Nobody at the airport to help us, so we had to call the helpdesk and try and explain this whole thing. Told on the phone that somebody would call back with a solution. When they finally called back after more than an hour, ensuring us that we could now get on the plane, we were told in the airport that it was too late: boarding had closed. Only beam of light in this was staff at the helpdesk who understood this was becoming rediculous  and he should get us home, so he booked us a different flight. Will never fly this airline again.",5/10
"✅Verified Review|  Marrakech to Casablanca. Poor communication and customer service. Our flight was delayed by 2.5 hours which resulted in us missing our connection on Emirates. I travel frequently and realise these things happen, though this is where Royal Air Maroc really fail in their customer service. Passengers started complaining to security staff approximately one hour after departure after no word from Royal Air Maroc. Royal Air Maroc finally sent a representative to the gate after 1.5 hrs after the flight was meant to depart to sort passengers out with connections. After 2.5 hrs we spoke to staff who informed us that we had been rebooked a flight the next day and we needed to pick up our boarding passes and accommodation voucher from the transit desk in Casablanca.  When we arrived at the transit desk where we were informed that they would deal with us shortly. This went on for more than 2 hours. Finally they advised us that we had not been booked on a flight as yet and they were working on our connection. A further 2 hours went by. Now 4 hours. No where to to buy food or get a drink. We were travelling with 3 young children aged 4 yrs to 9 yrs. We did ask staff about getting water though we were advised that we would have to clear customs buy water and then re renter though we would need a boarding pass which at as yet we did not have!  Finally they agreed to continue working on our connecting flight and organise accommodation. We passed through customs and and waited for another hour for them to organise our accommodation. We were advised that we were now booked on the flight the following day and needed to pick up boarding passes in the morning. We arrived at the hotel 6 hours after landing. At the hotel we found out that Royal Air Maroc had booked our rooms incorrectly. Luckily the staff at the front desk were helpful and were able to sort things out. The next day we arrived back at th airport an 10 am for a 3pm flight only to find out once again that we had been lied to and we were not booked on the connecting flight and the flight was overbooked! It now took a further 4 hours to organise a flight which did not help our stress levels. Finally we were booked on a flight after 9 hours of waiting at Casablanca airport.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Just as a pre-emptive note, I have flown many times and to Europe over 10 times and have never had such a horrendous experience. I flew out of JFK on March 23 2017, flight AT201 with a connection in Casablanca. The crew were inattentive and unfriendly. It was mostly an all-male crew. My TV monitor’s sound did not work and after 2.5 hrs into the flight of trying to get it fixed and trying to get their attention I finally gave up. They would never answer my attendant call button. On the return home it was even worse, I flew out of Rome, connected in Casablanca and then to JFK. From Rome on April 3, 2017 I was supposed to leave at 6.20pm, but the flight I was told was delayed 15 minutes. Well almost a full 6 hours later they finally got us on a flight at 12.10 midnight to Casablanca. There was little to no communication as to why we were delayed nor what our options were nor updates. Once in Casablanca at 2.30am we were just let off the plane with no explanation as to what to do, where to go, who to talk to or nothing. We got to the customs area where they gave us tickets for our connecting flight (we missed the 1st connecting flight, which was supposed to leave 10.30pm out of Casablanca to JFK) so the next available flight was at 2.45 pm (a full 12 hrs later). RAM did not tell us we could get a hotel or even where to go to get a voucher, I stopped at an information booth and she told me where to go. I got the voucher and the shuttle bus to the hotel, which was 4.00am by that time and got to my room. On the flight back to JFK again the TV Monitor sound did not work, but I didn’t even try to get them to fix it based on the last flight. Again the flight attendants were inattentive and unfriendly. The airport was scary, they were having demonstrations outside the area you had to walk thru to go to security and your gate.  I don’t usually complain but this was such a bad experience I felt I needed to write a review.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Utter Chaos! I had the misfortune of booking onto a Royal Air Maroc flight from Casablanca to Tangier at 11pm. I realised things were amiss when my coach pulled up to the plane and the lights were flickering on and off. There was an electrical fault, and the passengers were eventually sent back to the terminal. I can only assume all Royal Air Maroc staff then hid, as for the next 3 hours we were locked in the airport with no information and nobody to ask. There was a small passenger uprising, resulting in half the flight marching out of the airport. Chaos ensued and eventually at 4am a RAM representative arrived and directed passengers to a 'replacement coach'. When confronted by dozens of tired and angry looking passengers the surprised coach driver explained he was driving to Fez the next day, and we eventually established no replacement coach had been arranged. More chaos followed, followed by a 4 hour ride in a 1950s taxi eventually arriving 9:30am with no sleep. RAM promised compensation, but never paid and don't respond to e-mails. If you like planes that are well maintained and fly, arriving on time, customer service and compensation if things go wrong my advice is use another airline!",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  Flew Royal Air Maroc from Casablanca to Bissau via Praia. Departing at 11pm and arriving at 5pm I would expect to have a little sleep. However, the crew wakes you up when serving dinner. When stopping at 1.30 pm in Praia, they put all the lights on (OK, I can understand that, for security procedures maybe) and also the music! Why? In general, when departing from Casablanca, flights to Europe are fairly OK. But when flying towards an African capital, you can't expect to rest. Sometimes I feel like the crew doesn't want you to.",1/10
"✅Verified Review|  São Paulo to Geneva via Casablanca. Overall, I was positively surprised. Boeing 787 is an incredible airplane, and very quiet, which helps out with sleeping. Seating is spacious and there is lots of leg room and space in the overhead compartments. Check-in and boarding in Sao Paulo were comparable to any other airline and staff quite helpful. There was a line in the accommodation desk of RAM in Casablanca but it moved quickly, and I was put in a very nice hotel during my 15 hour layover, with dinner and breakfast included. My bags arrived normally in Geneva. No delays in any two flights. Problems with RAM though: the food is horrible, especially on the longer flight. Although the flavor was okay, it was very poorly presented, overall low quality, and not something you would expect at an airline. No alcoholic drinks on board, no snacks or extra beverages in between meals. Staff in the longer flight seemed impatient and not very willing to help. Bathroom was a bit dirty as well. On the shorter flight food was a bit better but still poorly presented. Staff was a lot more professional. My ticket was not cheap at all. I think overall the service of RAM was acceptable, but the food was a low point and reason enough for me not to fly with them again until I hear that has improved.",5/10
"✅Verified Review|  Frankfurt to Monrovia via Casablanca and Accra. Royal Air Maroc check in at Frankfurt Airport was efficient and painless. The flight took off a few minutes late but reached Casablanca on time. Food and beverage service on board was okay and a hot meal was served. After a 4 hour transit in a very dirty airport, the flight took off on time for Accra. Food and beverage selection was ok considering that only breakfast was served with nothing being offered on the Accra to Monrovia route. The fun started on arrival in Monrovia as one suitcase was missing. The necessary lost luggage form was filled in and submitted. After a week's interaction with RAM Monrovia office, the lost suitcase has neither been traced, found or delivered. A RAM employee confirmed that because RAM flights are very full, not all check-in luggage is loaded onto the aircraft which leads to inevitable delays and great frustration at the destination. In fact, the city office of Royal Air Maroc in Monrovia has turned into a heap of lost luggage and irate passengers have to daily go and search for their own luggage as RAM never returns any calls not appears to follow up on any enquiries. This is really shameful and my advice would be to avoid flying Royal Air Maroc at all costs.",6/10
"✅Verified Review|  Rio de Janeiro to London Gatwick via Casablanca. Had a really good experience flying to/from Brazil for the Paralympic Games on Royal Air Maroc. The Boeing 737-800's used on the legs between LGW and CMN are very clean and modern, incorporating the Boeing sky interior. Boeing 767-300's on the long haul sectors are showing their age but still very comfortable for a 9 hour journey. All aircraft had extremely generous legroom and the food on board was of a high standard, including alcoholic drinks. The cabin crews were all very professional and courteous. The only slight complaint onboard was that the IFE system on the B767's was rather temperamental and prone to resetting quite often, which made it impossible to watch movies. RAM accommodate transit passengers free of charge in a central Casablanca hotel if you have a long layover, which is fine and a nice touch, but can end up being rather fraught and stressful by the time you have travelled to/from the hotel and had to deal with the nightmare of negotiating the semi-organised chaos at CMN airport. Overall though, my impressions were positive and would certainly travel with RAM again.",4/10
"✅Verified Review| One-way flight Tunis to Dakar via Casablanca on November 29 on Royal Air Maroc B737-800s. Check-in at Tunis airport was quick and agent gave me window seats all the way to Dakar. Plane boarded with some organization with Business class and families first, then coach class. Not too disorderly so enjoyed that. Flight attendants were great and welcoming. Took off early and 2 1/2 hour flight to Casablanca. Delicious Moroccan chicken dinner was served with 2 drink runs. No sound available so they showed Bugs Bunny cartoons on the screens with no sound - sort-of strange. Why bother showing them at all? Just show the moving map - which they didn't have either. Landed on-time and bussed to the main terminal where the transit security line was insane. Be prepared for these kind of lines in western Africa and for disorder as passengers push and shove to get to the front. Dakar flight boarded with confusion as many carry-on's were too large for the overhead bins. So we were stuck on the jet-bridge as every passengers carry-on was evaluated. On-board it was a crazy free-for-all with people just sitting anywhere they wanted. Then when the passenger assigned to that seat came they either made the person move (as I did to the guy in my seat) to just grabbing an open seat - which then made the passenger in that seat make them move or look around. It was chaos but funny - the flight attendant saw me laughing and joined in - was just crazy. Ended up with a seat next to me open which was really great! Again take-off on time and served a delicious meal. Charlie Chaplin silent film shown which was perfect as again there is no sound on the airplane. And this time they also showed the moving map which was good. Landed on-time and bused to terminal where bags came out last but was just glad to get it. Overall I liked RAM a lot and would fly them again.",9/10
"✅Verified Review|  London Gatwick to Casablanca. Brilliant flight - unexpected after reading reviews. Smoothest take off and landing I've ever experienced.

"London Heathrow to New York via Casablanca. London to Casablanca was a pleasant flight with no delays. I had a great lunch on board with a choice of beef or chicken as well as a veg option. Staff were good, came to your attention straight away and were kind and spoke good English. With a short stop over in Casablanca Airport I went on board the Boeing 787 and  was amazed, completely different from the Boeing 737 on earlier flight. It had a new smell to it, the entertainment screens were large and overall its fantastic with a lot of good points. Food was fantastic, very hot and tasty. Staff were polite on this flight, great option of drinks and food. Entertainment great, loads of movies, tv shows, music and games. Everything is in English so nothing to worry about that, and you get a pillow, blanket and good quality headphones. Great experience with Royal Air Maroc. A really improved airline.",10/10
"✅Verified Review|  Nairobi to Montreal via Casablanca. The initial flight was canceled last minute, and they put me on a flight two days later. No compensation in any form (rebook for another route, food vouchers, credit, class upgrade, hotel) - nothing was provided. Still waiting from them for the delay report for my travel insurance company, but no answer for 2 month already. Customer service just does not give any answers to my repeated requests. I flew many different airlines in the world, and I am not a demanding customer at all, but would sugest avoid flying with this airline.",9/10
"✅Verified Review|  Montreal to Casablanca return. Ground service in Montreal, Casablance and Lisbon vague, aloof and  unhelpful.

"London to Marrakesh via Casablanca was a pleasant flight. The aircraft was waiting for me after I was 10 minutes late (long inspections). The food was alright. My son needed a change of nappy and one crew member helped me. Generous baggage allowance and once you arrive in Casablanca the is no hassle with baggage, as it is automatically transfered to the next flight. I advise you to have some euro or Dirham as you will be hungry waiting for the next flight and the only snack bar does not accept British pound. Flight from Casablanca to Marrakesh was quiet. Arrived on time.",5/10
"New York JFK to Marrakech via Casablanca with Royal Air Marco. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. I had never tried it, but the recent reviews made me want to give it a whirl. Glad I did.

All in all no complaints what so ever.",9/10
"In June and August I went from Madrid to Banjul return via Casablanca. Normally I fly with Tuifly from Amsterdam, but RAM had a good deal from Madrid. I was pleasantly surprised by the friendliness of staff. Also the fact that meals and beverages are served free of charge (even on the relatively short stretch Madrid - Casablanca) was a pleasant surprise. It is a long time ago that this service was also common with Tuifly and its predecessors. I will definitely choose RAM again!",10/10
"✅Verified Review|  Madrid to Rio de Janeiro via Casablanca. I did not believe the bad reviews before I flew but now wish that I had paid a little more and flown with someone else. The plane that we flew on (9.5 hour flight) had no TVs, my seat was broken and the overhead luggage compartments did not all stay closed during take off. The flight connecting Sao Paulo to Rio de Janeiro was cancelled: the staff refused to talk to anyone or give any information about when the next available flight would be. It then transpired that they had also lost our luggage! The staff were unhelpful and moody: the customer service department phone line is awful, I spoke to someone who hung up on me when I said that I wanted to speak to a manager and then gave a false name when I called back. A month and countless calls and emails later, we are still trying to get a cancellation certificate from the airline. Really not worth flying them.",9/10
"✅Verified Review| Paris to Bamako via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. Nice food. Business class seats ok. Friendly crew. The good stops there. Royal Air Maroc still has a very disorganised boarding policy, with 150 people waiting in the jetway for 30 minutes with no explanation. Casablanca airport is tired, RAM VIP lounge provides disgusting food and beverages despite a nice renovated layout. Royal Air Maroc got a nice facelift but the bad fundamentals are still there, especially when travelling to Sub-Saharan Africa.",4/10

At the gate we had normal seats where we could wait at the aircraft.The aircraft was 30 minutes earlier at the gate then scheduled, whihc mean we were able to enter the aircraft earlier. Departed on time. The service offered by the crew was good, they were very kind. The meal was not bad - I've seen better. And the seat comfort was perfect for me as 1,88metres.",4/10
"✅Verified Review|  Flying from Casablanca to Sal Island (Cabo Verde) on April 1st for holidays, we checked the country entry requirements with their embassy in Dakar (closest to Morocco where we live) and with Royal Air Maroc 2 weeks before the trip, and they both confirmed that visa is obtained at arrival. Also on the company website, under the visa section, they indicate that the visa is obtained at arrival. We check in for our flight, and are informed together with 15 other passengers that our luggage will be put on hold until we have customs clearance. At the customs, the officer in charge informed us that RAM has been applying a new rule for a couple of month, that they will not embark passengers without a visa on their passport, despite the fact that the visa can be obtained at arrival. They also said that we can embark if we have a clearance from the RAM lead station officer at the airport. We asked for him, but no one was able to give us either his name or to contact him. He only came after the plane took off to ask us to give him back the boarding passes (for an unkonwn reason) and then he left us there, at 1 am in the airport. A police officer at the airport told us that RAM has been consistenly refusing boarding to Moroccan citizens on this destination, despite the fact that they still communicate on the fact that visa can be obtained at arrival, even on their marketing campaigns on this destination.  Not only they treated us like cattle at the airport, but 2 weeks after the incident, and despite sending many complaints, we still have no feedback from them.",9/10
"✅Verified Review|  Amsterdam to Ouarzazate via Casablanca. Royal air Maroc offers a classic flying experience, a decent product including small hot meal and bagage at affordable price. Amsterdam to Casablanca departure on time, on board generous seating for economy and new lighting system on this Boeing 737-800. Staff in friendly, but not overly. Onboard a hot meal and drinks were offered on the 3hr flight. Baggage offers 23kg free. The connecting flight to Ouarzazate left 3 hours later and was delayed by 1hr. Unfortunately the domestic terminal offers almost no facilities - eg no ATM, just 1 coffee shop, wifi free for 30 mins. On the domestic flight no service offered on these flights of 30-50 mins. Miles credited promptly and expire only after 30 months. Royal Air Maroc has a lot of new aircraft and Casablanca airport is being upgraded at the moment. I would choose this airline above many others.",1/10
"Previous two trips, incredible long delays with no communication. Delays caused me to miss my connecting flights upon arriving in Morocco. On the way back, I missed my connecting flight home after landing at 11pm in Montreal. There were no crew in the airport to help me to get a new flight the next day or get me a hotel. My third trip this past week, Royal Air Maroc lost my luggage on arrival and had to go pick it up later next day at airport vs them delivering it to my hotel. On my return, we boarded the plane in Marrakech to Casablanca, waited for 35 mins and then needed to disembark because the pilot couldn't fly the plane. We were sent to Arrivals back in the airport, with no direction or communication on where to go. We waited until Airport Security asked us to move along and were directed to Checkin at arrivals and were told we would be taken to Casablanca via Bus and not plane. We collected our luggage and waited 30 mins for a bus to then again be told we are going to fly. We had to go through checkin and security lines all over again. It was the most chaotic experience with zero communication or direction.",8/10
"I was flying Royal Air Maroc from Marrakech to London via Casablanca, the original flight was delayed due to a problem with the flight, that's ok these things happen but we were left in the airport with no information and everyone just lied to or fobbed off, finally they got us to Casablanca where of course nearly everyone had missed the connecting flight. It took 4 hours of a hard struggle to get from Casablanca airport to a hotel. Worst day ever. Never again with RAM.",1/10
"Sao Paulo to London via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. The terrible journey began upon boarding when we are told the flight will be delayed by an hour. Baking hot cabin, no AC or power was available for the duration of delay. When you think things can't get possibly worst. To my surprise, it does. When we arrived at Casablanca 2 hours behind schedule, we found out the second leg of our flight has been cancelled. There were no staff waiting for us and we had to go to the office to fight for our way to the second flight. The staff were rude and unhelpful. In the end I arrived at London 24 hours late at an alternative airport. The service provided by RAM is unprofessional and did everything to the minimum standard.",1/10
"I used Royal Air Maroc from London to Casablanca and the flight was delayed 30 mins. If you have a connecting flight and are tight on time, forget it. Good luck finding a staff member that speaks communicative English. They offer 2 meal entrée options like beef or chicken, but ran out of choice for me. Rescheduling flights is a nightmare. You can't do it online as it gives you errors, and when you email them they send you an email to give them a call - when you call they don't pick up.",1/10
"It was a pleasure to fly with Royal Air Maroc from Amsterdam to Casablanca. Leg space was perfect, well kept plane. Exellent food and great staff. And this all for a great price. The only negative thing I can think of is the long time I had to spend at the Casablanca border control and collecting my luggage, but this is not all the fault of Royal Air Moroc.",2/10
Lagos to Copenhagen via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc was awful. I have never ever had such a bad experience with an airline. First they lose my luggage then they cancel my flight and ask me to stay in a foreign country for two days to wait for another flight! They don't answer when I call and the two claims I have sent them already has never been processed? I cannot recommend this company to anyone! You will get disappointed and when the bad luck starts you will get no help at all!,10/10
"Travelled Royal Air Maroc back from Rabat to Gatwick on New Years day.The flight left 10 minutes early and arrived nearly an hour early. The meal was fine with drinks etc. The staff were average to good. On the way there and the way home there were no duty free sales though. This is a new route to Morocco, long overdue, and saves two hours travel for me now not having to go to Casablanca.",4/10
"Accra to London Heathrow via Casablanca. I was apprehensive of flying Royal Air Maroc, however after checking in for an early morning flight from Accra, I was pleasantly surprised. The cabin crew were friendly and professional and the seating was good with plenty of leg room. We arrived early at Casablanca for the connection to Heathrow. My only negative comments are the ground staff at Casablanca airport. Lack of information, misleading signs to departure point and lack of staff at check points and transit area. Apart from that I will fly with Royal Air Maroc again.",7/10
"The flight was fine. The airline crew was hospitable. My problem occurred when I arrived Casablanca. My layover was 17 hrs for which hotel accommodation was promised by the airline. The ticket was bought only because this was part of the package. However upon arrival I was told that there was no available room. I was sent to sit at terminal 12, a room that appears to be a pastry shop. It is disheartening that a company would tarnish it's reputation by treating customers in such a callous manner. I am very disappointed with the service. I eventually paid US $50 at the hotel for a room with a twin bed - and shared bathroom. Dissatisfied customer.",7/10
"It was the first time travelling with Royal Air Maroc. Generally good. Nice seats, and the food was of good standard. I'd definitely recommend it, as it is cheap and good value for money. Staff were kind and helpful, and the plane was of good condition. For flying an airline for the first time, it's excellent. Only thing lacking is personal entertainment. Overhead screens showing boring circus show!",3/10
"Casablanca to Barcelona, and the first time flying RAM for me.  The Boeing 737 aircraft was not very new but it's well kept and clean.  The economy seat is one of the old styles which has thicker padding. The flight departed on time, I was served a hot meal, with a choice of beer or Moroccan red/white wine. The white wine was excellent. Tea and coffee also served. 2 male flight attendants worked in the economy cabin and the pace of service was good.  I paid $100 for a one-way ticket, which includes 1 checked bag. I don't know about medium and long haul flights on RAM but for a short haul flight in economy, this was good. The only thing lacking is personal entertainment.",9/10
"Lisbon to Conakry via Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. The aircraft was old with no entertainment and poorly maintained toilets. The upside is the hotel room being offered for long layovers. Yesterday's trip was one of the worst I have experienced. The plane from Casablanca to Conakry was fully booked and the staff was unable to handle boarding. While people were scrambling to board and to place the too many carry-ons in the limited space available, the staff was still stocking the plane, causing havoc, and there were quite aggressive verbal communication between staff and passengers unwilling to surrender their carry-ons. My assigned seat was occupied and a flight attendant asked me to accept an alternative seat, not to inconvenience the passenger who took my seat. After being offered several already taken places and a middle seat that I refused, the same flight attendant angrily told me to just take my seat and relocated the person wrongly seated. Horrible food.",10/10
"Lagos to Sao Paulo via Casablanca. We frequently fly long distance between countries and our goal is generally to find the cheapest ticket possible because we've found that flights and services can really vary. We didn't expect great but things ended up being better than our expectation. We had no issues with getting seats and people checking-in were nice. The staff was nice. Food and wine are good. I recommend you take a bottle of water each yourself, but that's a recommendation I would make for any long flight. The amazing part about RAM is that changing the flight generally costs only around 60 euros or so and they don't keep changing their prices. So, if you want a flight that's flexible, go with Royal Air Maroc. We ended up changing our flights twice! Comfort level etc. is okay on the flight, not great but you get the value for your money. Casablanca airport isn't great so try not to choose Royal Air Maroc if you have 12+ hours of stop there (we didn't, and I wouldn't wish that for anybody).",2/10
"Onboard Royal Air Maroc flight AT572 this Sunday, November 15th from Casablanca to Tunis. They made us walk from the terminal to the plane. The plane is dirty. Passengers cleaned their seat before sitting. Abviously the plane wasn't cleaned from the food of previous passengers. Sitting in the plane for 30 minutes now. No air-conditioning in the plane and suffocating!",7/10
"My wife and I traveled Royal Air Maroc from Montreal to Barcelona via Casablanca return in September 2015. I was very pleasantly surprised. Starting with the staff at the registration desk in Montreal who managed so that my wife and I could sit together for the trip. We were greeted by a friendly, smiling staff (somewhat less in Casablanca). The aircraft (Boeing 787-8 is new) was very clean and provided a perfect entertainment service, and I, 1m 85, had plenty of space for the legs. The meal with wine (bottle and not in a plastic glass) was hot and tasty. Our flight to go was more enjoyable. As regards to the return, it is regrettable that RAM does not take into account the link between two passengers. It sells tickets and seats in alphabetical order, so that people do not sit together. In our case, on return, this gave rise to a situation where travellers already on board began to negotiate with other passengers of the changes of places to be seated together. There were people who marched in the aisles to their new seats at cross-purpose of those who where boarding with their carry-on baggage. General confusion! I sincerely hope that RAM will solve this problem. Whatever the case, I strongly recommend Royal Air Maroc, a company that seems to be greatly improved.",2/10
"Absolute Nightmare. the Royal Air Maroc flight from JFK to Casablanca was OK. Flight from Casablanca to JFK was supposed to be at 2:55 pm Saturday. A morning check of website and email showed that flight was cancelled and we were rebooked for a flight at 12:30 am. Sunday. Shortly later received an email that it was rescheduled for 4:00 .m. No further emails and website still showed 12:30 am. Got to airport for 4:00 am. flight and found out that it had been rescheduled for 7:00 am. Luckily our tour guide was still with us and he got them to give us a hotel room for a few hours. Boarded on time but then sat in the plane for an hour waiting for every connecting flight to arrive in Casablanca. Then 20 minutes more while they found and removed the luggage of two people who did not arrive (no complaint about that - welcome safety measure). Finally left at 8:20 am. 17+ hours late. During the whole time on the ground and for the first hour or so of the flight there were 5 or 6 children screaming constantly at the top of their lungs. The parents apparently didn't feel any need to try to quiet them. The screaming combined with the nice Moroccan music played while on the ground it made it impossible to read, sleep, or listen to an audiobook. To top it off, US Customs forms were only provided in French so returning US citizens who couldn't read French had to find another passenger who could translate the form for them. In general, this airline is not up to the standards of other airlines. Boarding is just rushing to get near the front of the scrum so as not to be last to board. At JFK this got you onto the jetway but in Casablanca you then had to carry your heavy carry-on down a long flight of stairs, board a bus, and then carry the heavy carry-on up the shaky stairs to the plane (probably an airport not airline issue). JFK to Casablanca, flight attendants did nothing to ensure efficient use of overheads. No announcement about a 45 minute gate hold at JFK. Announcement in Casablanca that plane was being held for connecting passengers was not made right away. Food was skimpy. Nothing on tray to drink. Served coffee and tea after a while but water wasn't brought until after food was eaten. They didn't come around with water during flight but if you knew about it you could go back to the galley and help yourself to water. No beverage service on Casablanca to JFK flight until just before arrival after the dinner trays were given out. By the way, don't buy water at the Casablanca airport to take on the plane. They have security people at the gate go through your luggage to take it away or force you to drink the whole thing right there. There are three security checks: one to get into the airport, one to get into the passenger only gate section, and one at the gate. Don't get rid of your water until the last one. We got rid of the water that we had with us at the second security check then paid $3 for a 50 cent bottle of water to take on the plane but had to give it up or drink it up at the last security check. I had to drink the whole thing there in order to have the empty bottle. My friend had an empty bottle in her bag which was taken away, maybe because she had the cap on it and they didn't realize that it was empty.",8/10
"Paris to Marrakech via Casablanca, and while the flight experience was as expected, my connecting 10:30pm flight from Casablanca to Marrakech was abruptly cancelled with no explanation. We waited for 3 hours with other stranded passengers until they arranged a bus to drive everyone 3 hours to the Marrakech airport. They refused to make stops at hotels and saw no sign of customer service. We were treated like a burden. Subsequently, my return flight from Marrakech to Paris was cancelled without my knowledge and the Royal Air Maroc check-in counter brushed me away to the ticket counter (which was vacant). I was luckily rebooked and made that flight, but overall the worst attitude I've seen from an airline.",4/10
"This Royal Air Maroc flight from Casablanca to Berlin was delayed by more than 2 hours and I had to reshedule my connection flight. I have to travel a lot to Casablanca, but Royal Air Maroc is never on time and this is very frustraing. Now I have booked my next flight (in two weeks) and also they canceled this flight and put me on another flight that departs more than 2 hrs earlier. I really don't understand the rating because this airline is under-performing. Unfortunately I cannot change airline because of my route.",2/10
"Was highly impressed with my first in-flight experience with Royal Air Maroc. Impressed with the meals served, the hospitality and the in-flight entertainment and superb shape of their high-tech Boeing 787 I traveled with during my transit from Morocco to New York, JFK.",3/10
"Checked in online, there was a delayed boarding process which is normal for Ataturk Airport. Boarding process was chaotic, it commenced then the cabincrew refused entry to people on the aircraft and we waited in the airbridge for ten minutes. On board experience was woeful. Crew could not speak basic English. Was given the option of ""meat or beef"" for my meal. Aircraft was filthy and tired looking. Seats were not comfortable. There was nothing about this airline that made me want to fly with them again.",10/10
"Another dreadful experience on this airline. Checked in online but was advised at the airport that customs do not accept online printed boarding passes so I needed to check in again at the airport. This was an easy enough process. Prepare for many passport and security checks at Casablanca Airport. Boarded about 30 mins late and arrived late into Ataturk due to heavy traffic. Inflight experience was not nice. Cabin temperature was cold, then too hot for most of the flight. Food was average, inflight service was not nice. Staff were surly for the whole flight. I will try not to fly with this airline in the future.",2/10
The aircraft was a chartered Boeing 767-300 from a Portuguese company. It was very old and the worst confort I experienced in the last 2 years. Seats were very old. Quality of Food was miserable. Portuguese airline Flight attendants could barely understand any language but Portuguese. Royal Air Maroc is abusing its monopoly of YUL-CMN route and not respecting customers.,1/10
My first time with Air Maroc and I was pleasantly surprised. Both flights (Marra to Casa en Casa to A'dam) departed right on time. Casa to A'dam had meal service (at no extra cost) with a choice of chicken or fish. The female flight attendant in 1st class (which I didn't use) was very friendly however the two male attendants in economy were quite surly. All in all not a bad experience!,2/10
AT200 April 28th CMN-JFK. Flew in the new Dreamliner flight was OK the food was horrible staff friendly at times except for one very rude attendant.,6/10
Check in was rapid in Marrakech. We were allowed 2 suitcases of 23 kg each. Entertainment was OK during flight. Food was OK. The fish was good. My hungry wife asked for a second meal. The arm rests of our seats were falling apart and glued with some glue that did not work. The staff were friendly. We flew Marrakech-Casablanca-Montreal.,6/10
12 April 2015 from Lisbon to Casablanca: I liked: 1) Flight on schedule. 2) Good pilot skills on landing. 3) Good leg room. What I didn't like: 1) The stewardesses were very unfriendly and rude with no smiles. 2) Drinks and food were below average. I was served a dry sandwich made several days ago. 2) There were dry splashes of food/drinks on the seats. 3) Old plane 737-800 that surely needs to be replaced.,7/10
I flew business class on Royal Air Maroc AT 200 last April 9 2015 from Casablanca to New York JFK. The flight was 1.5 hours late which caused me to miss my connecting flight to California by 10 minutes. The RAM representatives at JFK seemed eager to go home and did not assist the 3 or 4 of us who missed our connections. They refused to provide hotel or meal vouchers and basically left us stranded. We asked to speak to the manager but after waiting for a long time they said that the manager will not show up. RAM seems not to have heard of customer service.,4/10
Geneva-Casablanca AT931. The flight with RAM was a pleasure. Brand new and very clean Boeing 737-800 CN-ROS on time. Good legroom clean and brand new! Nice smiling and professional cabin crew all announcements in Arabic French and English. Decent hot meal (chicken and fish to choose from). No IFE but a duty free was available on this airplane. Very good flight.,1/10
Flew out from Montreal to Casablanca on March 21 with almost 2 hours late departure. Connecting flight to Tenerife was ok. Next flight on March 28 from Tenerife to Casa was late so we miss our connecting flight to Agadir. No airline staff available to assist. Had to find out by our self how to proceed inside the airport to book on the next flight. Casablanca airport had no internet available and no working phone so please bring your cell with a plan for Europe. You also need cash for the restaurants as they don't take credit cards. The trip back from Casablanca to Montreal was 11 hours late. No communication whatsoever from Royal Air Maroc and no way to inform our family. The washroom ran out of water mid way to Montreal. Water and pops was self serve at the back of the plane. I will never use this airline again and I believe it's better to pay extra and fly with a reputable airline.,10/10
Casablanca-Munich. After horrible experience of Casablanca airport flight with RAM was a pleasure. Brand new and very clean Embraer 190 on time. Good legroom nice leather seats in olive-brown colour with red accents. Nice smiling and professional cabin crew all announcements in Arabic French and English. Decent hot meal (chicken and fish to choose from) excellent chocolate cake. No IFE or duty free available on E190. Very good flight.,1/10
"Flights mid January from Montreal to Casa and return early February. We were dissatisfied with this airline except for the fact that we arrived safely to both destinations. The service was not ""royal"" both flights were uncomfortably delayed the first by about 12 hours then the return flight by 24 hours which resulted in additional costs to us so a negative number re value for money. The seats were average for an economy flight ie. not great. On the flight to Morocco the meal was packaged pastry we had to chase the flight attendants to get bread and water. The plane was an old 747 the machine to make hot water for tea or coffee was not working and there was no inflight entertainment. On the way back in early February on a 767 the service meal and movies were good (3 star vs 0 stars averaging out to the one star below).",9/10
Just flew from YUL to Casa on the older 747 operated by Royal Air Maroc. I was hesitant after reading reviews but alas I was pleasantly surprised. We were first to check in as we were unable to do online check-in in Montreal - no big deal if no one could then I was happy we were all in the same boat. Our agent was fantastic and have us options as the flight was basically empty but wanted to ensure my friend and I (both 6ft) would have ample leg room for the 6hr flight. Boarding was efficient and our ticketing agent was doing the boarding procedures at the gate. As we boarded the plane I was horrified to find no head rest entertainment system - but I was prepared with a charged tablet and phone. Needless to say our flight was a 2200 - I did plan to sleep a bit. Little disappointed the seats didn't recline - but again it wasn't just mine it was everyone and took comfort in knowing that those without the exit row weren't going to have their knees crushed by the person in front of them. The meal was better than any bought sandwich I've had on Air Canada would say for economy class this was above standard. The attendant told me I could take a row of seats to myself. Woke up a few hours later with an hour and a half till touch down changed my seat so I could look out of the window. A female flight attendant came by and said if I wanted breakfast I would have to go back to my original seat and then disappeared. The original steward who showed us the empty section told me he couldn't stop me from going to the back of the plane with my breakfast handed me my tray in the galley and promptly asked if I w anted coffee with a smile. Breakfast was bland pastries and juice and applesauce. So yes this isn't the all star Middle East type of airline experience but for 900$ return amazing service we got fed got to sleep and I would fly with them again my other options were to fly via turkey or London or Paris for a considerable amount more.,1/10
Jan 23rd from JFK to CMN then from CMN on 19th Feb 2015. Flight departed JFK on time and arrived Casablanca almost 1 hour early! Staff at JFK were kind and helpful no complaints there. The only thing that got me worried was when the luggage took a long time and then one of my suitcases did not come off. I spoke to a luggage handler who located mine. The trip from Casablanca back to JFK was just as pleasant. I experienced no problems with their service inflight the food was just as good as most other airlines (and I have used many). The plane was clean both times I flew on them there were no delays and the staff were kind enough. I most certainly will be using it again in summer to visit my friends!,8/10
Upgraded to business class on flight AT201 from JFK to CMN. This was the first leg on the way to SSG in Malabo Eq. Guinea. The pros: great leg room in business. 2-1-2 staggered configuration with two rows. The cons: worn seats control for entertainment system not working so I had to get up and use the touch screen. My other issue was a dingy bathroom with bar soap. The flight attendants were not what I would rank as the friendliest I have met. I am glad I did not pay the full price for this business class. To be fair on the way back on AT200 they used a 767 in which the business class appeared to be upgraded. It was 2-2-2 with more modern entertainment systems.,10/10
Royal Air Maroc continues to under perform which is frustrating for both frequent flyers or casual traveller. Latest CMN-NY flight non-working equipment and poor service overall. While understanding the air crew doubtless finds the current equipment deeply depressing (as RAM waits for new Boeing deliveries) the carrier really needs to step up interim maintenance and training to reach its potential and the stated Africa hub aspirations.,5/10
Used business class service from Gatwick to Marrakech. Service was superb food well presented and really delicious. The cabin crew spoke excellent English. The cabin was modern and very clean with really comfortable seats. The toilets were very clean and the plane was on time going and coming. The service reminded us very much of the seventies and eighties when services and food on most airlines were of a very high standard. Even though the fares were much higher than their competitors the end product was well worth it.We shall be using them again next year.,3/10
My latest return flights with Royal Air Maroc were Casablanca to Agadir return. Both flights were on time (in fact one departed early so make sure you are at the airport with plenty of time to spare) boarding is very efficient planes clean with quite good leg room and cabin crew friendly. There was no meal service this being only an hour flight. I had excess baggage on both flights but it was easily sorted at both Casablanca and Agadir airports for a small extra fee. I have now flown a few flights both domestically and internationally with RAM and am very pleased with their service. They are reasonably low cost which is even better.,4/10
I travel round trip JFK-Casablanca two to three times year for the past three years. Prior to that it was at least once a year going back 35 years. RAM is shortest and least expensive flight. Royal Air Maroc casts a bad image on the country. The 767s flying out of JFK are a mess. Broken seats toilets overhead bin locks and entertainment systems. Dirty seats carpets galley and toilets. The galley area is trashed after the first meal and the crew treats it like their clubhouse. First class doesn't come close to other airlines upgraded coach double or triple the price and not worth the cost. If you want the least expensive and quickest flight and can put up with horrible conditions for 8 hours than take RAM. Otherwise fly via Europe on another airline.,10/10
I had a return flight from LGW to RAK. Both the outbound and return flights were on time and boarding was nice and early so there wasn't a scramble to get everyone on board the aeroplane. On the outbound flight I was given an emergency exit seat which meant I had plenty of legroom. However even on the return flight seat pitch wasn't an issue. The food was poor. I had ordered a vegetarian meal and on the outbound flight it was inedible. The food on the return flight wasn't very good but at least was edible. Drinks were supplied and wine was also on offer. As the flight is only 3h15m I see the food as an added bonus rather than a deal breaker especially as the alternative is to with EasyJet or Ryanair who don't supply any free food or drinks. There was a video being shown during the flight but I spent the time reading so cannot really comment on the entertainment.,1/10
Avoid this airline at all cost! Worst flight I have ever taken. JFK to Casablanca - we had assigned seats for the 3rd row and ended up in last row. My wife's seat was broken and overhead lights didn't work. After meal people literally bussed their trays as staff were no where to be found. Flight attendants were inept and surly.,9/10
Was due to fly from Marrakech to Morocco to catch connecting flight to Copenhagen. On arrival at Marrakech airport learned that flight was cancelled. No staff available and no information forthcoming. After a while was shepherded into a filthy bus which was in a horrible state with basic safety equipment such as seatbelts and emergency hammers missing. After a hot 3 hour bus ride (A/C not working) arrived at Casablanca airport only to find that airline had not informed of our delay due to their own cancelled flight and s gate closed and flight due to depart. Found an airline rep after a while and miraculously flight dep. was delayed and we boarded. Inflight service extremely poor. Not enough food; not enough drinks and only one service on a 3.5 hour flight with no possibility to buy further. Staff ignorant and disinterested. Toilets filthy and smelly.,1/10
Terrible customer service. Travelling in business class connecting via Casablanca because of a delayed onward flight I was forced to change flights and wait there for 24 hours. These things happen fine. A key measure of service quality is how the airline then reacts when things go wrong particularly for premium customers. I have rarely witnessed such complete disinterest. It took me six hours - from 9pm to 3am - to get the airline to rebook me find my baggage and promise me a hotel. The guy who was issuing hotel vouchers then disappeared for hours without explanation or apology leaving myself and 20 others stranded. Eventually I had to take a taxi to stay in a hotel in the city 30km away at my own expense. Upon return to the airport the next day I asked to speak to someone senior to file a complaint and request reimbursement and was waved away. I work for an organisation which flies thousands of professionals in business class with the airline each year - even when made aware of this their level of service remained pegged firmly at zero. A 48-hour nightmare.,1/10
I was supposed to travel from Casablanca to London the flight was overbooked the check-in was hectic the staff rude. No solution was offered no compensation. I had to take two flights via Barcelona and it took me 8 hours to get to London instead of 3! The staff were unhelpful and so unfriendly. I will never travel with them again.,1/10
Outgoing route - London Heathrow to Casablanca (flight AT 801) Casablanca to Banjul (AT 557) 23rd July 2014 arriving 24th July. Return. Awful service. Entertainment? What entertainment? No radio inflight movie or children's entertainment packs have ever been evident on any of the RAM flights I have been on. Every flight I have taken we have ordered non-dairy vegetarian meals - but they never materialise. This last flight (yesterday) they tried to serve us a family of lifelong vegetarians chicken! The staff refused to believe that vegetarian meals had been ordered - even when I produced the tickets which clearly showed vegetarian non-dairy meals were specified for all 3 of us. Transfer times at Casablanca are woefully inadequate which has always results in our luggage getting a few days extra holiday time without me - and there is always a slight of hand which somehow negates any chance of remuneration. This is an awful airline.,1/10
"On Aug 24 we get to Casablanca airport at 1am for our 4am flight to find our that it was rescheduled to 8.30am. No prior notice or updates on RAM's website and airport screens still showed 4am at 6am! There was a mob of passengers whose CMN-JFK flights had been cancelled the previous two days trying to get updates from a couple of clueless RAM employees. Concerned that we would get booted off our flight I asked a RAM agent who exactly was getting on the 8.30 flight. She said it was for passengers with confirmed seats on the original 4am flight. Her supervisor later confirmed that I and the other five people in our party had no reason to worry. We sat and waited our turn to check in. When we got up to the counter at 6.30am to our surprise the check in agent said ""sorry but we only have 3 seats left!"" After some back and forth we were put on the next flight at 5pm. She said because we were the only Gold FFs on the afternoon flight and business class was half empty they would make it up to us with an upgrade. In the meantime she sent us to one of their offices to get hotel vouchers where we could stay for the next 8-9 hours until the next flight. I got up to that office and of course there was another mob and more passenger-staff arguments. I got a chance to briefly speak with one of the RAM agents there and he said there was no hotel availability near the airport and what he could offer us was a hotel downtown (45+ minutes away). We declined and stayed at the airport. When it was time to check in for the afternoon flight the agent at the counter said any ugrades would have to be done at the gate later the gate agent said there was plenty of availability in business and we were the only ones on the upgrade list but that she could not do it - it had to be done back at check in or by the crew inside the aircraft! Nonsense. We get inside the aircraft and of course the head of crew says ""we appreciate your loyalty but the upgrade had to be done by the agents."" Forget it. We get to JFK we zip through US immigration with Global Entry passes only to wait close to 90 minutes for our bags!",1/10
AT206 on Aug 17 CMN-YUL from Casablanca to Montreal delay of over 18 hrs in Casablanca we were not informed of the issue before. Due to their delay I missed my Westjet flight between Montreal to Edmonton I was told in Casablanca to provide them with information about my flight in Canada so they could rebook me with Westjet but when I arrived in Montreal there was no one to talk to from RAM team so I had to pay for my flight on my own. The ground staff were extremely unfriendly and rude to customers. No assistance or information provided all passengers were extremely frustrated. Flight chartered from Euro Atlantic with a 767 in very poor cabin condition.,1/10
"I travelled to Agadir from Heathrow with a connecting flight from Casablanca. The outward bound journey was fine. On the way back there was a delay. Instead of leaving Agadir at 6.20 we left about 9am. There was only rude unhelpful staff on the desk a woman who made no eye contact and gave incorrect information. Finally got to Casablanca. My friend who was travelling part of the way with me had a delayed flight again and was given no information. We went to the information desk and was greeted by two female members of staff (one was eating something and spoke with her mouth full). She had no information on the delayed flight and said ""I will ask my mate"" who consequently sat there and smiled and did not speak. We were sent up and down the airport several times waiting for a meal voucher (we had left our hotel at 3.15am that morning. Eventually my friend got a voucher for refreshments about 12 hours later and finally managed to get his flight home about 5pm that day.",4/10
AT208 on Aug 2nd CMN-YUL from Casablanca to Montreal Delay of over 6 hrs in Casablanca. The ground staff were extremely unfriendly and rude to customers. No assistance or information provided all passengers were extremely frustrated. Flight chartered from Euro Atlantic with a 767 in very poor cabin condition.,1/10
I travel JFK - Casablanca three times a year coach. Best price and shortest flight from U.S. They are now using 767s. If you are lucky you will get an upgraded aircraft with nice seats and seatback screens. The older cabins are well worn may not have a movie seats are soiled and can have an order. Since the planes are usually full expect the toilets to be a mess after a few hours. Plane departs and arrives on time unless JFK is having problems. When boarding try to get to the head of the line. I usually don't care since everyone gets on board but many Moroccan travelers have a lot of carry on and the compartments fill up fast. No baggage fee for two bags but 50 lb limit each is enforced. Overage is costly. Food is fine and plentiful but I have lived overseas a long time and not fussy. If you are picky carry something on. Casablanca: terminal is fine. Arrival is easy. Departure check in 90 min early because delay at counter with people re-packing bags because of weight and of all the check points. Airport police and immigration officials are efficient and rarely discourteous. Go to gate area and relax. There is a restaurant. If you keep your expectations low you will be fine. This is not a North American or European airline but is adequate. Remember your destination Morocco is wonderful!,1/10
I flew from Marrakech to Casablanca and missed connecting flights due to delay with the first flight. The staff were extremely unfriendly and rude to customers. Only one or 2 staff at the Transit Desks assisted however others were frustrating with their efforts. Staff treated travelers badly.,7/10
I flew from Ldn Heathrow to Casablanca (return) and overall it was a fine experience. On the flight to Casablanca the staff were extremely unfriendly and rude to customers at times but if you don't need much interaction with them then I suppose it doesn't matter too much. On both journeys I had chicken and rice which was very dry and tasted pretty dull but edible. On the return flight the bread roll was so stale I couldn't cut it open let alone eat it. Leg room was actually quite good and I was able to stretch my legs - however I am only 5ft 3! Both flights smooth except for a dodgy landing back into Heathrow. I probably would fly with them again if I was left without a choice but if I could choose an alternative airline I would.,1/10
Travelled with RAM from Pointe Noire Congo to Casablanca and onward connection to London. Given the negative reviews here I was more than a little concerned. I needn't have been. Both flights punctual unexpectedly good food OK crew. Only gripe was the 737-800 CMN-LHR had old non-reclining seats.,4/10
Aircraft was a nice looking B738 (CN-ROT). Flight departed on time the crew were nice to the passengers. When entering the aircraft we heard Moroccan music which was nice. The food was not bad. Seats were normal (I am 1.85m). The only thing that was not good was that the cabin crew did not inform passengers what they had to do if they have a connecting flight.,7/10
Accra-Casablanca-Brussels 500$ for a one-way ticket. The baggage allowance was very generous 3x23 kgs and 10 kgs of hand luggage. Check-in was smooth and departure on time. The old 737-700 offers limited comfort and on the Accra-Casablanca there was not any form of entertainment  headphones were not distributed. The breakfast served was limited to a small cake a minute cup of yoghurt and a bread roll. The tray wasn't clean and there were traces of food on it from a previous passenger. The Casablanca-Brussels leg was a little bit better with acceptable food and more friendly staff. Nobody beats their price and that's why I give them 6/10.,8/10
Flew BRU-CMN prices were far too high! 550 euro's round-trip even a trip to Dubai is cheaper! Flight was a pleasant one no delays - on time and some nice food served aswell.,6/10
We flew round trip JFK from New York to Casablanca to join a group going on a Jewish tour of Morocco. We were very pleased with the service provided by Royal Air Maroc. Both flights were on time. The attendants were friendly and helpful and the security was excellent. We would definitely recommend Royal Air Maroc!,5/10
I have been flying for almost 3 years now between Amsterdam and Casablanca (sometimes Tangiers). I fly about 5 round-trip flights a year with Royal Air Maroc. This is the only carrier to Morocco that I will be using!,4/10
Germany-Agadir return. 2 hour wait at check-in in Berlin. Only one jetway at aircraft more waiting in the December cold. No boarding pass was issued for connection in Casablanca. Transfer counter in Casablanca: A bulk of shouting passengers rather fearing to miss their flights due to the level of proficiency. Mobile boarding passes cannot be used to pass security. You have to use your force to obtain the boarding pass. Worst transit ever. Arriving in Agadir our bags were lost for three days. Return flight was good and almost on time. That prevents me from giving a worse review. All in all. Not again. By no means.,9/10
Cairo to Casablanca. Where do I even begin? Flight delayed for 5 hours and no announcement was made on the reason. No food or beverage vouchers were handed out. The flight was on the filthiest B737-800 I have ever been on. Food was simply inedible. The crew spent the entire flight chatting among themselves. The bathrooms as many reviewers here have pointed out were disgracefully filthy.,6/10
I traveled twice in economy on their B747-300 from JFK to CMN round trips and didn't encounter major issues with the airline. The food and service was very good when I requested a change in seats they helped me right away. The plane was clean seats were comfortable and their personal screens had decent entertainment. I even had an incident were I lost a ring in the bathroom and the flight attendant found it and gave it back to me. Their timings are good I never suffered from delays. I also think that many times their tickets are overpriced.,1/10
Casablanca to Paris return. Food excellent and crew very friendly. Excellent omelette for breakfast. New leather seats on both Boeing 767-300 from Casablanca and return on Boeing 737-800. I was surprised with their improvements. Both legs on time.,10/10
Went from Casablanca (Morocco) to Sao Paulo (Brazil) in January 2014. There was nice space in economy class but the airplane (an old Boeing 747-300) was not well maintained (broken tray seat that did not recline properly) the toilets on-board were dirty. There was no individual screens and the sound system (for the movie or music channels) were not working during the flight. Nice dinner but terrible cold breakfast. The crew were inattentive and rude.,8/10
I just had a short flight from Casablanca to Marrakech with Royal Air Maroc Express and the overall experience was good especially considering the bad reviews I had previously read. Check-in in Casablanca was friendly and helpful.,2/10
"BCN-TNG. Both legs were operated by old tired Boeing 737-500. BCN-TNG: check-in and boarding disorganized priority passes were not respected. Toilets on-board were dirty and smelly food was served cold and only 30 minutes before landing. Rude and impolite cabin crew with an exception for the Chef de Cabine who did his best. Inbound flight: 2 hours delay even though the aircraft was parked on tarmac no explanation. When I tried to get some information to RAM ground staff at Tangier I was told very harshly to sit down wait and mind my own business. Only one W.C was operative ""breakfast"" consisted in a dry piece of brad and an inedible croissant no jam no butter. Rude and ignorant cabin crew. I wonder how that ""airline"" can still be flying. Obviously never again.",5/10
I was due to travel from Casablanca on 6th of September (never travel on Friday) to Barcelona. Despite arriving early there was a long queue at check in. As is usually the case at Casablanca there was much shouting and arm waving during the process with the police called to moderate one argument which looked to be heading towards a fight. Eventually got to the front of the queue to be told that the flight was overbooked and they had no seat for me. I was given a boarding pass for the direct flight to London at 3pm the next day. I explained that I did not want to spend another night away from home and that I would like to transfer to any other flight to Europe. I was told there were no seats available. I was given a slip of paper to take to the cashier to claim 1500 Dirhams compensation. The cashier refused to pay offering only an upgrade to business class for my next flight. I spent some time at the ticket office trying to get another ticket to anywhere but was told that the ticket office could not issue tickets and that I had to queue up at a check in desk to ask if there was space on a flight. I did this twice which took until after lunch. I finally admitted defeat and went to the airline's accommodation office where I eventually was given a voucher for a local hotel.,3/10
I flew Air Maroc from JFK to Casablanca on July 12 2013. The flight was great. I did not encounter any of the negative comments I usually read. It was a great flight with very good food and excellent private entertainment.,1/10
Last month I flew from Barcelona to Casablanca and on to Marrakech. First flight was supposed to be at 4pm and it was cancelled. Next flight was at 8pm but it was overbooked and I didn't get on it. Booked on a flight at 10pm. This was delayed and we left Barcelona at 11pm. We arrived so late at Casablanca that we missed our connection to Marrakech. Tried to get information from staff but they were really unhelpful and not able to find any solution. Finally after 3 hours wait at customer services we were booked on the next flight to Marrakech which was at 11am the next day. Nobody helped us and all the staff we approached from the Royal Air Maroc were rude.,4/10
"NY-Casablanca-NY this past week. Outbound flight delayed 5 hours connection from Casablanca-Barcelona delayed another 5 hours. Airport staff for RAM were not helpful with no useful information. No one at Casablanca airport knew about our flight timing the standard answer was to check the screen. The seats onboard were not spacious service was unfriendly. The bathrooms were filthy at the time of departure both ways half way through both flights there was toilet paper on the floors counters were constantly wet. Food was palatable but considering the fine quality of Moroccan cuisine this airline meal didn't match up. On arrival in Casablanca we got bussed to the terminal. If you even remotely consider asking anyone for anything at Casablanca Airport they will ""beg"" for money so keep a lot of spare change handy. Ground staff at RAM Casablanca are the least helpful they don't speak any English!",1/10
The flight was horrible. Rome to Casablanca - had no one to help us - the plane was dirty service poor very unfriendly and not willing to talk with us even though we were trying to speak to them in French. Arrived 2 hours late - luggage didn't had to make repeat trips to the airport to wait for planes to come in to see if luggage was on it one bag did not arrive until the day before we were to leave - 9 days later.,1/10
After a pleasant flight with Egyptair to JFK my return was from Montreal to Casablanca for a conference on Royal Air Maroc. A dreadful experience from start to finish. Only one inedible meal was served on the nearly 11 hour flight. Crew was rude and disinterested. The 30 year old B-747 had no individual entertainment but a hazy barely functional overhead TV monitor playing what seemed to be a century-old Arabic film. As others have reported the bathrooms were very dirty. Never again.,1/10
London Heathrow to Casablanca June 4th 2013. After reading the many negative reviews on this airline we were very pleasantly surprised. We departed on time the flight crew were pleasant and the meal was good. I only used the bathroom early on in the flight but it was spotless. Legroom is a little cramped but overall we were very happy with the flight.,1/10
June 17th. Casablanca to Dakar Senegal. Our second flight with RAM in a fortnight and again we were not disappointed. Flight left on time aircraft was new the meal was very nice and the flight crew pleasant. We chose RAM because it was a direct flight and the price was reasonable.,9/10
Flight supposed to be direct from Marrakech to Marseille. In fact flight Marrakech to Bordeaux (500 kms north of Marseille) then stop for 40 min blocked in the plane then flight Bordeaux - Marseille. 4hrs 15min instead of 2hrs 30min. No notice from Royal Air Maroc before plane registering (if they advised people could have taken Ryanair flight leaving around the same time!). In the plane no place for the legs very poor food no entertainment.,9/10
AT850 last Monday. A good flight with RAM. 738(RGJ) this aircraft has a sky interior that was very nice. Crew were not too friendly. The food was good and service was not bad for the price I paid (€105). I really like the seats. One thing RAM needs to do: FA's need to be more friendly to passengers.,2/10
Montreal to Casablanca. Prices: higher than any airline out there. Seats not comfortable and food horrible. Staff not friendly at all. I wish there was another airline on the same route.,7/10
CMN-LHR. The experience was shockingly bad from start to finish. Chaotic boarding which left London-bound passengers worried that they may end up in Toulouse no explanations given for delays very cramped seating announcements (including the safety demo) made in barely audible barely intelligible English the list goes on. I've also never seen a cabin so poorly maintained.,1/10
Montreal to Casablanca in economy class. The seats were tight and not comfortable. The food is so-so. The toilets are dirty. It seems like they don't clean the aircraft very well. The entertainment is almost non existent with TVs dating from the 70s. Too bad Morocco has a monopoly on the Montreal - Casablanca flight otherwise I would never flight with this airline.,4/10
2 round-trip flights between NYC and Casablanca within the past 3 months and every time the conditions haven't been clean. When I asked for the filthy bathroom to be cleaned the staff acted like it wasn't their job. They take out water bottles prior to flight but then don't provide enough water on the plane. On some planes the seats don't recline. The ear phones don't always work.,3/10
Recently flew to Casablanca and back. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the flight. In business class the food was delicious fresh and served nicely. Video quality was good as was the selection of films although the headset was not as comfortable as on some other airlines. Arrived early and had to wait a little for a gate at JFK but I can't blame the airline for this. Would not hesitate to recommend the airline and plan to take it on my next flight to Morocco and perhaps for a connection elsewhere in North Africa to avoid connecting in Europe.,1/10
Beirut to Casablanca and a week later Casablanca to Cairo. Both sectors were on old. tattered and filthy B737-800's. The food was horrible to say the least. The crew was a mixed bag with male flight attendants tending to be slightly friendlier than female staff. No IFE of any sort with just overhead video screens scattered throughout the planes playing the same old Egyptian movie again and again. But the worst thing is surely the disgraceful condition of the bathrooms. They were absolutely revolting and smelly and not cleaned throughout the flights. Royal Air Maroc is surely the worst airline I have ever been on.,9/10
Flew on March 30 from Rome to CMN. Was apprehensive after reading such negative reviews. However we had no problems at all. The plane was in good condition the staff courteous and the snack was OK too.,1/10
Was scheduled for Barcelona-Tangier. Showed up at the airport 3 hours early no check-in staff. 1 hour before departure still no check in staff - was told the flight had been cancelled no reason as to why. I was given a call centre number. They rescheduled me for the following night's flight - no explanation. The flight had a further 2 hour delay the next night. The aircraft condition was a mess. Dirty cramped smelly. The food was substandard. And that was the fastest safety demonstration I have ever seen in my life - no more than 3 minutes. Landed in Tangier 35 hours late. Lesson learned they will not have my custom again.,7/10
Flew Barcelona to Tangier. Turned up at BCN airport 3 hours prior to the scheduled flight time. Check in desks were abandoned. About 1 hour before boarding there was still no one at check in. A number of passengers phoned the airline to find out what was going on only to be told the flight had been cancelled. No notifications were provided to any of the passengers and the flight was rescheduled to the following day. Not even the information boards in the airport reflected that the flight was cancelled. I had to go back to my hotel and come back the following day only to find the flight times had been changed twice. When I did eventually get on the plane the interior was in a pitiful state and the flight staff were appalling. Never again.,na
Lisbon to Marrakech via Casablanca. Lisbon to Casablanca left on time with connecting flight in Casablanca cancelled with the option to wait in Casablanca domestic (!) airport for flight or be bussed to Marrakech. I took the latter and arrived after the flight would have as immigration delays and luggage retrieval delayed the bus departure. Royal Air Maroc staff were overall dismissive and generally begrudgingly helpful except for the fellow who got us to our bus: he worked hard against all odds to get us to Marrakech. Worse to come on return - Marrakech to Casablanca flight sort of left on time but again delayed in Casablanca for 1.5 hours with no help from RAM staff other than to be coldly told to 'go sit and wait for 45 minutes. 1.5 hours later we departed. Given late arrival in Lisbon I missed connecting transport resulting in additional expenses and very late in the night arrival at my destination.,na
Just returned home from Marrakech. Aircraft was B737-800 but the crews weren't very professional and friendly (I had to remind them several times that I wanted water and they turned the TV on an hour after take off). Aircraft interior and toilet during the first leg (Frankfurt-Casablanca) was bad and the food was 'so- so' as well as not being generous enough with portion. Will not fly with Royal Air Maroc anymore.,na
Paris Orly to Marrakech and return - had little choice but to take this option and basically got what I expected average / poor service in old aircraft and a tired crew. No entertainment on a 3hr flight seats uncomfortable and cramped. Won't be going back if I can help it.,4/10
CMN-LHR. Check-in was slow and disorganised dealing with a passenger's overweight baggage in front of us at the counter took them nearly half an hour during which the check-in attendants changed shift! Boarding was a shambles - 15 mins after heading into the airbridge people started coming out again for what reason I am not sure but it resulted in both staff members leaving their posts at the gate so random people could just walk onto the plane. Those of us at the back of the queue got on without anyone looking at our boarding passes! Meal was tasteless mush (I chose the fish) and the announcements were deafeningly loud and distorted. For this reason they decided not to play the movie which we can be thankful for. Plane was a bit old but not too bad comfort level was OK but seats weren't the greatest.,4/10
Everything was horrible. Dedicated check-in at CMN airport completely chaotic no enforcement of cabin luggage restrictions (business class overhead bins already stuffed when I boarded the plane) cabin interior both old and dirty service limited to an absolute minimum.,1/10
Marrakech-Bordeaux 5/3/2013. Flight on time in fact was early. Crew were smart and attentive. But the aeroplane was filthy. My armrest was broken and there was food splattered all over the back of the seat in front. Carpet was filthy with rubbish strewn about.,na
Flew from Marrakech to Fez (via Casablanca) in business class. The business class is in name alone. Its just a scam to charge tourists twice as much with the same seats no meals or drinks no service no airport lounge and no priority boarding. There are multiple parts of the plane's interior which are falling apart. And then finally your bags are lost and you need to travel to the airport yourself every night to see if they have arrived (as they won't deliver them and won't advise you if they have arrived).,5/10
Just flew back from Casablanca to JFK - the airplane was dirty. The food was terrible. My daughter is a coeliac - requested a gluten free meal when booking and told no problem. They gave her a regular meal with bread and cake. Advised them it was a problem - they looked at us like we were crazy. Service from the flight attendants was terrible. Wanted a glass of water - went to the 'kitchen' area - 2 flight attendants were fast asleep. The bathrooms were disgusting. Never Again.,na
Montreal - Casablanca return on 767-300ER. Seat pitch was okay. Outbound the food and washroom cleanliness were okay. On the return however food and washroom cleanliness were far from good - and water wasn't offered during the flight (had to go to the galley when required). Ceiling-mounted TVs were not visible from our seating positions. Flights pretty much on time and no baggage issues.,1/10
My wife and I flew from Paris (Orly) to Marrakech and return 2 weeks ago. After booking on-line in Australia we had questions about the boarding information which was written in French. After receiving no response from their published call centre after 5 attempts we gave up and. The flight itself was awful. Our seats and meal trays were filthy and we had to wipe them down with hand wipes to remove food and other material. On the return trip there was no room in the overhead lockers for our carry on luggage. Cabin crew just asked to me to hold the bag in my lap and it wasn't until we started moving that they asked me to stand up and put it in the business class area. Other passengers took calls on their mobile phones during the take-off run. Will never fly RAM again.,7/10
We fly direct from JFK to Casablanca. Service is terrible plane is filthy. On my most recent flight it was delayed 4 hours with no apology our seats had no padding and mid flight there was a flood down our aisle from the bathroom. Food is awful and there has never been a movie on board. In the past our seats have been sold to someone else and we were forced to stay in morocco another day. They are the only direct flight from JFK to Morocco.,1/10
Casablanca to Bologna 1 hour delay. Nobody apologized. Food horrible toilets and aircraft not well maintained and not cleaned.,na
CMN to NKC. Took off almost an hour late of schedule and crew have never apologized. Food terrible for business class. The plane was not terribly old but serious lack of proper maintenance on the interior. Went to the lavatory and I just don't want to go there ever again because of the lack of maintenance. Baggage handling was OK. The service from the crew member was mediocre.,3/10
RAK-CMN-TNG on ATR 72-600 with 2.5 hrs layover in CMN. Aircraft quite new but not that clean. Seat pitch was ok and seat quite comfortable. No snacks were given on board. I think the price was not reasonable for such short domestic flight.,4/10
"Marrakech-Munich on B737-800. Flight departed and arrived on time. A bit tired looking 737 not too much leg room but clean. Very nice attentive and smiling cabin crew hot breakfast (some pancakes yoghurt jam honey cream cheese bread roll) hot drinks and fruit juices and water. IFE of overhead monitors with air map and some comedy shorts. Quite surprised how ""ok"" the flight was although seats would be more comfortable with more legroom.",4/10
Domestic flight Casablanca - Dakhla and back. Flight times re-scheduled 1 hour later a few days before departure without any mail - or text notice. Food just terrible small dry white bread toasts. Will not fly with them again if I can avoid it!,8/10
Flew Montreal to Tunis via Casablanca and back in April 2012 and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of all four flights. Flights arrived punctually. Service was attentive and friendly. Baggage arrived at destination safely. The stopovers in Casablanca were rather a problem as passengers without dirham's were unable to pay for a coffee or snack. Yet all in all I would not rate this airlines any worse than others I have used for example Delta.,1/10
4 domestic flights recently - Most of the aircraft (ATR72) were dirty shabby and very worn which doesn't give a good first impression. Not sure what the cabin crews role was as they did nothing other than hold up at safety card at the start of the flight no inflight service whatsoever not even a glass of water which would have been appreciated on the longer sectors. Leg room was poor as was the general seat comfort having said that 1 flight was on a brand new aircraft 4 months old comfortable adequate legroom clean very quiet and a pleasure to fly on still no service from the crew though!,8/10
Our flight from JFK to Morocco was fine. We took off 2 hours late but that did not affect our connection to Marrakech. Flight home went as scheduled. Experience was not unlike many US airlines.,2/10
I flew JFK-CMN many years ago and boarding was chaotic and disorganized. People ran to the counter in a stampede there was pushing and shoving. I stayed in my seat in the lounge until the crowd had boarded. I couldn't understand this as all had assigned seats. Years later boarding was much more civil and rows were called. I must add however that the airline food was excellent despite the 6 hour delay at JFK. Given a food voucher however still ended up paying approx 5 USD extra because the voucher was inadequate for the price of food at JFK.,6/10
Little leg room noisy compartments no music channels working on either flights. On one of 2 flights (round trip JFK to Casablanca) 1 of 4 toilets were broken and on both flights the toilets were filthy. Attendants indifferent and most of the time could not be summoned. Meals poor (though on return flight the fish was excellent). Almost impossible to get anything to drink during flights. Sat on tarmac 3 hours in Casablanca on return to JFK.,3/10
Recently flew from London to Casablanca return. The first flight was ok. The second was terrible. There was so little legroom that I had to sit with my legs splayed apart for the whole flight and the top of the seat in front was only about 4 inches from my face. On take-off the seat in front of me collapsed backwards and I ended up with that passenger in my lap. The seat in front of my wife would not stay in the upright position so that seat was reclined for the entire flight including take-off and landing. Cabin crew checked seats and seat belts 4 times before take-off but didn't once notice this. We were not given any arrival cards for Heathrow on this flight and the food was terrible.,1/10
Casablanca to JFK - total lack of inflight service. My biggest concern was the drinking and rowdy crowd of 6-8 men standing and sitting in the back of coach the entire flight. After landing at JFK while we were taxiing and waiting for a gate they continued standing and walking about along with flight attendants. Many others were up and removing their bags from the overhead bins while we were taxiing which lasted for over a half an hour. Flight attendants made no attempt to stop or secure anything. I had had two very small glasses of water for a 7 hour flight and nothing else to drink. They offered nothing other than coffee or tea with the snack service.,na
Flew to Casablanca from JFK return to JFK. Flight left 5 mins later than scheduled. Much better that most US flights. Plane while a little old was clean decent meal and reasonably friendly attendants. Entertainment needs to be looked at but was a night flight so sleep was needed. Arrived 30 mins before scheduled. Return much the same. Problem was at JFK. Waited 30 mins to disembark and another 30 mins for our bags.,4/10
Pleasantly surprised when flying from Madrid to Casablanca. Boarded 45 minutes before scheduled-take off seat 18A is recommended (exit row = loads of legroom) and landed 40 minutes early. Crew efficient if a little serious. Difficult to fault and beats the Iberia flight from Heathrow hands-down.,8/10
BRU-CMN-BRU. Both flights had delays. Return flights were 2 hrs late. Ground crew not helpful and not able to give us information. Food onboard was very bad. Cabin crew service was neutral. I will try to avoid in the future.,8/10
JFK-CMN. Delayed 2 hours aircraft was very old nothing worked correctly bathrooms not clean and the stewards did not care! If you asked for anything they would not provide it don't be surprised to hear things like we are on break!. They should act on this ASAP or lose customers.,na
Montreal to Casablanca. At check-in I was told my second piece of carry on would cost me an additional $150. I managed to stuff everything from my backpack into the two pieces of checked luggage and my roller bag. When we boarded passenger after passenger boarded with two pieces of luggage. I complained and was told that it was too late to do anything about it. No apologies no empathy. Service on the flight was abysmal. You had to ask two and three times for anything and then it was provided with a surly attitude. Attendant working our section was reading a paper when the plane landed. Terrible experience I won't travel them again!,1/10
JFK to Casablanca. Flight delayed 2 hours. Plane and equipment obviously quite dated. My headphone connection on the seat didn't work many connections didn't. Bathrooms were dirty odour was horrifying little to no soap or tissue paper. Return flight to JFK was similar except the bathroom a bit better. On both flights flight attendants were courteous and kind. I'd rather pay a bit more and feel comfortable on another airline.,2/10
"Return JFK-Casablanca. Equipment is very old food was awful the 2 bathrooms near my seat were closed down 3 hrs into our 7.5 hr flight. Neither bathroom had soap and tissues instead of paper towels. TV screens were so old we could barely discern the figures on the screen one movie shown the whole flight. Many seats were broken. Stewardess near me sat on a box with her head against a pillow reading a newspaper. When passengers came by for extra water she lifted her head and nodded as if to say ""take the water yourself"".",1/10
Economy legroom LHR-CMN return in a 737 and A321 respectively was non-existent. Once one person had reclined their seat others were made even more uncomfortable which cabin crew seemed oblivious to. Many trays didn't work and onboard entertainment system started during the descent to LHR. Outbound journey the cabin crew spoke French and Arabic but English was utterly incomprehensible.,na
Unfortunately once again Royal Air Maroc's staff let them down. CMN to LHR - absolute chaos checking in nothing works baggage labels not printing took over 1 hour just to check 1 piece of luggage in - no apology no explanation. Upon boarding it was noticeable that the level of cleanliness was not up to scratch. Staff spoke broken English and were all rather rude. Half way through the flight I started to get a head-ache switched on the attendants light and sat there in excess of 20 minutes before a very kind fellow passenger actually went up to the business class section to speak to the crew manager. The attendants replied 'We are not on duty now - we do not have to serve you anymore'!,na
Good value for money. We flew SVO-CMN CMN-JFK return. Cabins were in a fairly good condition dinner was great and very tasty. In addition to hot meals there were salads cheese cream and oriental sweets. Flight attendants were friendly and spoke three languages. Each seat was equipped with a blanket pillow headphones and eye mask. The airline falls from grace with constant delays of 20-40 minutes but despite this they often arrive on time.,na
RAK to CMN and CMN to MPX with my old sick mother. On first leg boarding my mother from the wheelchair to the ATR42 was a nightmare due to lack of elevators at the airport. But crew was professional and patient. Plane was in excellent condition. Even on a 40 minutes flight we were offered of a glass of water or cup of coffee. Second leg on an oldish 737 was no problem for boarding through jetway. Legroom was above average. Food remarkably tasty compared to the average. Crew friendly and helpful. I ask for my mother to use the business class toilet due to short distance but hostess denied I asked the head steward who said yes and was very kind and helpful. Crew spoke good enough English. Fares are more expensive than average but flights to Europe are priced per leg so I was not forced to buy a return ticket ending up using only one way.,4/10
Morocco to JFK. Terrible airline from the service to the condition of the planes. Boarding was disorganized. Aircraft dirty attendant kept scolding a woman for reclined seat during take off however seat would not go into the upright position! Restroom door did not close properly. Food was awful. Movie restarted over 3 times - 4.5 hrs to watch 1 movie sound was awful old monitors. Upon landing many passengers stood to retrieve bags while the plane was still racing along the runway attendants said nothing. When we finally arrived at the gate the aisles were filled with passengers and their bags so we couldn't even stand up.,7/10
Washington DC to CMN. DC to JFK was smooth. JFK to CMN was poor. The overhead buttons weren't working the sound on the old fashion screens was mute with no headphones. FA's were rude and impolite one flight attendant got into a verbal argument with a passenger. I have to say it is getting annoying to accept this treatment.,1/10
We flew direct from JFK to Casablanca. This airline is definitely not up to par with other airlines. The plane is shabby with many of the overhead lights and call buttons not functioning. The bathrooms are dirty and not maintained throughout the flight usually no soap and runs out of toilet paper early on. The outbound and returning flights were on time and actually arrived slightly early and our bags arrived intact. On the return flight there were 2 young girls travelling as unaccompanied minors seated across from me. The flight attendants did not check on them throughout the flight. In fact when the meals were served the flight attendant was very brusque with them when asked to choose which meal they wanted. The flight attendants did not show any extra care or compassion for these young girls travelling by themselves. Interestingly we also took a domestic flight from Casablanca to Marrakech and this flight was excellent! The plane was very clean and modern and the service was decent.,2/10
JFK to CMN. Boarding started on time but as RAM has no rhyme or reason to their boarding process we took off about 30 mins late. Slept for most of the flight dinner was above average breakfast was just an assortment of pastries/yoghurt. Arrived on time. CMN to JFK - again disorganized boarding. Left approx 40 mins late. Upon take off 3 or 4 overhead bins popped open. The passengers around me kept looking for an attendant to rush to assist since no one seemed to notice we were all scared luggage would fall on us. The attendants weren't rude just indifferent. While the aisles filled with trash and the bathrooms became filthy during the 8 hour flights the attendants did each others make up and played with their phones. Little to no leg room. The technology was laughable. Old TV's spaced too far apart and the picture quality was laughable. One movie for the 8 hr flight maybe 2 TV shows and I couldn't hear anyway since my seat didn't have audio. Overall landed 45 mins late. Below average experience.,3/10
Casablanca to Laayoune Morocco and Casablanca to JFK. First trip was wonderful first class seating and very attentive staff. From Casablanca to JFK however it was a completely different story. During the 6.5 hour flight I saw the flight attendants twice - once to drop off our lunch once a few hours later to pick up the garbage before landing. People had been pushing the call buttons but attendants never responded. The inflight video system was horrible and the aircraft was dirty. Conveniently I was on an aisle seat near the galley so I continued to get up and refresh my drink and snacks as I chose.,4/10
MAD-CMN Business Class. Flight departed on time nice service comfortable seats and good food and wine offered. The only problem I had was in obtaining a boarding pass when transiting through Madrid from Heathrow. With the assistance of a helpful Iberia lady I was finally able to get a (hand written) boarding pass but only after some hours. This is a very strange arrangement as the RAM aircraft leaves from the same Terminal (4S) as I had arrived off a BA flight yet the RAM office is literally miles away.,4/10
No booking availability to use a Hong Kong HSBC credit card to book a flight from Morocco to London. This airline has no desire to help their customers! They don't deserve our business. Unfortunately they hold the best flight options to travel from Morocco to the UK. If I could find another way I' do it!!,7/10
Late departure from Heathrow. Once in Casablanca the boarding gate was wrong on our boarding cards and there was no one to help the information screen was showing all other destinations except ours. When we finally found the gate after running around with our two young children at midnight we find that the flight was going to Guinea before Gambia as our schedule said. Once in Guinea we waited onboard for a 1.5 hrs for refuelling and cleaning. Staff are not welcoming nor helpful. Once in Gambia 2 or our 3 suitcases were missing and after daily trips to the Air Maroc office in Gambia and the Airport they arrive.,na
As long as this airline continues to have a monopoly over all travel to North Morocco it will continue to be poor with little incentive to improve its punctuality prices and customer service. The airline is extremely unreliable in my experience. Connecting flights are a bad idea on all 3 occasions that I have travelled to North Morocco (Tangier) on a connecting flight my experience has been negative. Most recently my flight from London to Casablanca was delayed 50 mins and so I missed the connecting flight (which allowed a 1.5 hr stop over) and was left at Casablanca airport from 11pm until 4am without food refreshments accommodation or a customer service representative to assist or provide answers/information.,na
I had booked a flight from Casablanca to Amsterdam together with some 50 or 60 other people. Already during check-in a delay started without explanation or information. Staff behind the desk disappeared came back but the line waiting for check-in did not shrink. Impatient travelers roamed around the hall and came back with different information. RAM staff did nothing until noon when some vouchers for a lunch were distributed. It appeared around that time the flight was cancelled and that another plane might take us. We had been waiting for hours without any form of information. At 18.30 we were ordered to get onto a bus which took us to the delayed plane. First class had been transformed into second class room for your legs had been halved obviously to store more people aboard and most of them considerably smaller that I am. With a stopover in Al Hoceima we finally landed at 3.30 in the morning (local time) at Schiphol so that I had some 4 hours before my next flight to the Caribbean. My luggage arrived 5 days later.,4/10
Montreal-Casablanca. Scheduled 19.25 checked in 16.55. Boarding pass stated boarding 19.00 not a word by check-in staff about any delays although it was already known to them. Arrived at gate 18.30 no one from airline showed up. Monitors showed original departure time well past 19.30. No airport staff inside the departure hall had any answers and no RAM staff were available until 20.10 when the first new departure time update appeared on the monitors. Flight was delayed until 22.15 and no RAM rep bothered to show up at the gate to inform passengers. Finally station manager turned up 20.45 to say that we all should have received food vouchers at check-in but of course he just had to say something. Plane finally left 23.15 and it was clear they skipped bathroom cleaning during the short ground time that the toilets smelt before the first use.,na
We had no problems in terms of flight times or delays. Flight attendants were quite nonchalant and not particularly friendly. The most worrying thing was the state of the aircraft.. Not only was it shabby inside and out there was a huge crack across the emergency exit door and rust all over the wing. Overall I would say a very shabby airline and poor customer service.,na
Cancelled our original flight to Morocco from JFK due to weather then they failed to notify of the rescheduled time. Because they had failed to notify so many passengers the rescheduled flight was delayed causing us to miss our connection in Casablanca. After having to spend a night in Casablanca we arrived in Marrakech 40 mins late only to discover our bags had been lost. On our return arriving at the airport in Marrakech we went to check-in only to find our flight home was oversold after seeing 3 different agents they finally issued our boarding passes. We thought things were finally running smoothly until we arrived in New York and discovered once again they had lost our bags. The delays and baggage issues were exacerbated by terrible customer service.,2/10
We received an email 4 days before we were due to fly cancelling both the outward and return flight. The plane was old and dirty. The staff surly and not interested in serving you. The toilet smelt and they closed the front part of the plane off and told passengers to use the one at the back. Some people complained and ignored this rule.,na
JFK to CMN. Good quality food friendly staff and a smooth flight. Plenty of movies magazines/newspapers provided.,1/10
"Awful airline and only getting worse. Due to budget cuts flights are often cancelled at the last minute and passengers are rerouted from direct flights to itineraries that consist of up to 3 extra flights. The airline will list several flights available but then combine all the passengers for that day on one flight. This makes travel with RAM impossible if you have a connection with a different airline. While travelling to Paris my husband and I had made separate reservations. For some reason he was told on a Monday that his Saturday flight had been cancelled. I was not alerted until Thursday that the same flight had been cancelled. My mother recently flew from JFK to Casablanca. It took her friend 2 hours after landing to receive her baggage. My mother's baggage was left behind in NY. We were told to call back the next day when the suitcase should have arrived on a flight coming in at 8am. The next day I called three times hours after the flight had arrived and was told that they could not confirm that the suitcase had come in. One customer service woman refused to let me speak to her supervisor and hung up on me! We ended up paying a 50$ taxi fare to go to the airport and were told to look for the suitcase ourselves by two employees who were sitting and gossiping and playing with their cell phones. Finally we found an employee in a back office who was willing to do his job. He went to another part of the airport and returned with the suitcase. The suitcase had a huge yellow tag on it that said ""RUSH"" and yet it was 8 hours after it had arrived and no one could confirm it was in Casablance. In short avoid this airline like the plague!",10/10
I cannot recognise the airline that I have used for 20 yrs from some of the comments made. I usually fly Economy LHR to CMN but as I have had a problem with my legs recently I have switched to Business class. In both classes RAM has been totally satisfactory. I have never had a flight cancelled or changed before the day of departure I have only once had a more-than 3 hr delay and in this case cans of drinks were immediately provided and 40 mins later all passengers were taken to a restaurant in the airport. Cabin staff with the odd exception are friendly and helpful especially when they realise I speak some Arabic. The air miles programme is extremely generous. The planes are modern and clean. Even the older planes which I occasionally take on internal flights are satisfactory. One time my baggage went on to Marrakech and was not offloaded at Casa. It arrived back at Casa at 7am the next morning and I was given 300 dirhams compensation for the taxi to and from the airport. This was several years ago and I imagine the compensation will have increased to cater for higher taxi fares.,na
Lisbon airport for our return flight home to Riyadh via Casablanca but there was no flight and no Air Maroc staff to assist us. When I got hold of their Portugal office there was no answer. I called their number in Morocco and was told that the Lisbon-Casablanca flight had been cancelled and they had been unable to reach me. They offered no solution other than a flight 8 days later else I should send a complaint to their email address. At the peak of summer travel season I was forced to purchase new tickets for my family on other airlines to get home. The initial journey from Riyadh to Madrid via Casablanca didn't go smoothly either - they got our luggage to us 5 days late.,8/10
I have flown Royal Air Maroc many times to W.Africa over the last 6 or 7 yrs and the company is getting worse. I flew BCN-CMN-DKR return the return trip was appalling. Both legs DKR-CMN and CMN-BCN the crew were surly rude and incompetent. The 2 767 aircraft they have are old and the crew made no effort at all. The emergency procedures were done so that people sitting near the door weren't able to observe contrary to international law because they told me there were only 4 crew for this flight. Due to the consistent downfall of this airline I will not be using them again for W.African routes.,na
Experience with flying Royal Air Maroc from Frankfurt via Casablanca-Marrakech can be summarized as: Old and dirty airplane +5 hrs delay in Casablanca without any explanation from ground crew no service from staff several people in same flight did not get luggage until several days later.,4/10
I have flown with Royal Air Maroc many times it's a very good airline and it has a reputation I can't seem to find when I'm on-board their aircrafts. Staff are very good and great with customer service. I was flying from London-Tangier and one man decided to smoke in the toilets the staff took this as a serious problem and treated him fairly and when we landed in Tangier he was arrested it's good to see action taken. They served lunch which I always love I had the chicken with rice and potatoes very tasty. Royal Air Maroc is a standard airline with great seats and very friendly staff their English is superb so no communication problems will occur on-board. It was very clean I called a member of staff 6 times during the 3 hr flight she was very happy serving me all the time.,na
CMN-AMS. I have flown Air Maroc multiple times and when everything goes fine they offer quite good value for money: food served on European routes plus wine and beer and a generous baggage allowance for several European and African destinations:30 kg. And their loyalty program is good too. But when there is a disturbance nobody ever takes responsibility for anything and that is infuriating. I've seen terrible scenes on board which are beyond a Hollywood movie. Although I'm sometimes disappointed I will usually fly them again.,10/10
I flew with Royal Air Maroc to Morocco. I bought a package that made me take a Delta Connections flight from Boston's Logan-New York's JFK. The Delta flight was bumpy! Once at JFK I made my way over to the terminal. I had to wait 8 hrs for the plane to show up. I knew this ahead of time the Delta flight was a morning flight and the Royal Air Maroc flight was at 6:32 PM. Once it was time to board the line was ridiculous. Once on board the Boeing 767 I sat down and the seats were comfortable and reclined reasonably far. About 1hr into the flight they served dinner. There was a menu and all the meals were hot. If you're ever on thus flight get the chicken. The flight was very smooth the cabin crew was very nice and also served breakfast. The landing was excellent very smooth. The 8 hr wait wasn't too bad.,6/10
Not impressed at all. I flew from London Heathrow-Casablanca which was bearable although the staff were very rude and aggressive - they obviously have no customer service skills. I would probably lose my job if I spoke to customers the way this airline's staff do. The return journey was a shambles - the original flight from Marrakech- Casablanca was cancelled and no explanation given so I was put on another flight at a later time which meant I made the connection from Casablanca-Heathrow with mins to spare. Again the staff were rude patronising and arrogant the food was unidentifiable and no apologies were given in respect of the cancelled flight added stress and subsequently lost baggage (which I am still waiting for).,7/10
Please do not book with this airline if you want to save yourself the stress anger frustration and rudeness that we experienced. We booked a return flight from LHR-AGA. Our outbound flight was delayed by 4 hrs so we missed our connecting flight from CMN-AGA. It took more than 14 hrs it should have been less than 8 hrs. Our flight home was horrendous. We managed to get a flight from AGA-CMN but as we hurried to get our flight to LHR we were refused boarding even though we had valid boarding passes and tickets. The rude check-in staff told us that there was a problem with our tickets and to speak to our booking agent. It turns out our tickets were cancelled without our permission. We were stranded at the boarding gate. The only reason I could think of was that the airline had double booked their seats because there was a large crowd of passengers before us and 2 more passengers also had their tickets cancelled and were in the same situation as us. The check-in assistant did not help us and sent us from pillar to post asking us to speak to the customer team downstairs when our flight was about to depart. We enquired about getting our luggage back and we were told that it was being offloaded. However our luggage was not offloaded and it flew to LHR. We were told that the next plane to LHR would be in 24 hours. We protested (with 2 other passengers) eventually a person at the airport gave us tickets to LGW (not LHR) which would be a 10 hr trip on 2 planes going via Tunisia. We were not given any food or drink for the inconvenience caused. We arrived at LGW at 1am in the morning without our luggage. We should have been in LHR by 6pm. We had to pay a mighty fare to get from LGW to home we didn't get our luggage for another 3 days. Overall a nightmare of a journey we wrote to them 3 times demanding an explanation for this unacceptable journey. They have not replied.,1/10
My experience with RAM has been you get less than what you pay for. We were flying NYC to Guinea via Casablanca in NYC it took 2 hours to check us in because the counter person did not know the country code for Guinea and then he lost all the information and then there were issues with not believing a passports validity etc. We were travelling with an infant who was on our lap you must pay to have the infant on your lap which is fine. Except in NYC they booked our daughter on a different flight than us out of Casablanca. We did not notice this until we got to Casablanca. They refused to give my daughter a boarding pass to get on the plane! Saying she had to wait in Casablanca for two more days because that is when her ticket is for - she is 17 months old! We finally managed to find someone with a brain who said to check her in she is an infant - and then the plane was only half full so I really don't understand the problem there! The flight attendants were beyond rude they served drinks only once during an 8 hour flight when I asked for some water for my daughter's cup they would only fill it 25% full - so I had to keep getting up and going to the galley to pour my own drinks. The bathrooms stank the plane was falling apart.,na
Roundtrip BCN to Tangiers. It's a different world on RAM. Passengers move around during take- off and landing. Women seated together in groups with the kids and the men sit together up front. No respect for personal space poor service despite large cabin crew.,1/10
"JFK to Casablanca delayed 9 hours with no communication from ground crew. RAM employees rounded up the passengers into a ""holding area"" then disappeared for 9 hours. No food no water no pillows or blankets and no apologies. The flight was just as bad - rude and arrogant staff. I don't know how they manage to stay in business. I guess it should have been a huge red flag when I called to book the flight - no answer not even an answering machine just rang until I hung up. Had to call between 10 and 3 to book I was later told. Avoid this airline like the plague.",1/10
Montreal to Casablanca to Marrakech return. Meals excellent inflight service excellent - staff extremely helpful to families travelling with children.,na
Booked a return London Gatwick-Casablanca - on the day of departure a text informed us that the return flight was cancelled and we would be put on a later flight to a different airport. We had additional costs of hotel meals and transfer to our original departure airport and had to cut our holiday short. No apology made and still negotiating with them regarding payment for the taxi to the original airport. Complete lack of customer care - the representatives appear to deliberately absent themselves so that they do not have to deal with queries and shoulder shrugging seems to be their preferred response. They are really hopeless and should be ashamed of their customer rating.,4/10
Gatwick to Marrakech return. Both flights on-time planes were fine food good - for economy class food it was better than some airlines I have previously flown including Qantas and Icelandair. We had no problems with service. Our only problem was the stopover in Casablanca on the outward flight as the transit lounge facilities are very poor insufficient seating and availability of food and drink was very limited. There are improvements being made at present but in the meantime we would avoid the route via Casablanca and book direct flights both ways. The staff were are all time polite and available. We will certainly fly again and would recommend this airline as great value for money and definitely preferable to the ghastly budget airlines that are the alternatives.,na
Madrid-Dakar (thru Casablanca) and Dakar-Casablanca. It was terribly overpriced but our 3 flights were on time luggage was delivered 20 minutes after landing. The flight itself was not very comfortable and it was shaking all the time but we were too exhausted and slept on all flights and time passed fast. Flight attendants were ok but on each flight woke us up to offer food service!,7/10
Dreadful experiences with this airline - the day before leaving a person who only spoke French called and wanted to reroute us to a flight with a 6hr wait in Casablanca. The return flight was even worse - an antiquated aircraft had some technical problem in spite of which we were boarded and unboarded 90 minutes later. We were then trapped in the duty free airport zone no rep in sight most of the time people at the customer service desk (no English poor French) RAM staff treated us like dirt arrogantly refusing to give information. Passengers had to beg for meal vouchers but the airport cafe had only stale cheese bread rolls and quickly ran out of them.,6/10
We received a phone call while in Marrikech saying the morning flight to Paris was cancelled and we were to take a later flight. Later I was called again and told that flight was cancelled too and we would need to take a late-night flight. I called back and said we needed to be in Paris before the late flight left what other options were there? The call disconnected. We stopped by RAM office in downtown Marrikech took a number and waited about 10 minutes. The agent booked us for a morning flight to Paris changing planes in Casablanca. The flight to Paris was jam-packed with more carry-on luggage bags etc. than I'd ever seen. This flight departed 7 April at 12:20. Somehow the crew managed order from the disorder got bins shut fed everyone on the flight came round with more drinks and worked hard. Didn't like the two cancellations of our flights or the long connecting flight but RAM got us there.,na
The worst airlines I have ever flown. The flight was from Geneva to marrakech with a connecting flight in Casablanca. Our flight from Geneva to Casablanca has been cancelled without any prior notice. I tried to fix the issue over the phone with RAM. The first person just hung up and the second was not helpful and informed me that all fights are fully booked and they don't have any solution to propose! After one hour of negotiation RAM proposed me other flights the same day arriving late in the night.,6/10
They've changed my departure time 4 times so far causing me to have to change connecting flights with other airlines over and over again - with the resulting change fees. Now it's going to take me 3 days to get from Casablanca to Colorado with overnight in Madrid and again in Dallas. After reading these reviews I'm pretty much terrified that I'll make the flight in and out of Casablanca at all.,na
"London Gatwick to Agadir via Casablanca. On the journey out we were in the queue to check-in at Gatwick for around 2 hours. This meant we had 10 minutes to get to the departure gate for boarding meaning we could not even stop to get refreshments before our flight. When we connected in Casablanca we boarded the plane and were left sitting on the runway in sweltering heat for over an hour without any explanation from cabin crew. On the return flight to England we arrived at Agadir airport at 3.50am to catch a flight to Casablanca at 6.30am where we would connect for London Gatwick. On arrival at the airport we realised that our flight was not on the departures board. We sat and waited for over an hour in a deserted airport with no members of staff or representatives to be seen. When finally a RAM representative did appear he simply shrugged his shoulders and told us that the flight had been cancelled giving us no explanation or apology for this having happened. We tried to patiently negotiate another route but the representative was utterly nonchalant and uncaring about the inconvenience. He worked out a route for us to catch a flight at 9.30am to Casablanca from which we could then connect at 1.40pm to London Heathrow. Although we explained that we had initially booked to go to Gatwick again he simply shrugged and told us that this was our only option and ""take it or leave it"". He even went onto say that it was a difficult situation for him as he was the one who had to listen to us. We waited for 5 and a half hours in Agadir airport to board the 9.30am flight. When we arrived in Casablanca our connecting flight was delayed for an hour and a half meaning we had to sit in the departure lounge listening to a imbecilic woman talking constantly on the tannoy for four hours. When we touched down in Heathrow it was 7pm - 7 hours after we were initially supposed to arrive and at the wrong airport. We were herded from pillar to post once off the plane; initially the gate into the aiport being 'accidentally locked' so we were all standing waiting in a small corridor and then being asked to go back to the departure lounge to wait for further instruction regarding the promise that had been made by the representative in Agadir that we would receive transportation to our homes due to the inconvenience of arriving at the wrong airport. Initially we were told by Heathrow staff that we would only receive transport to Gatwick but after patient negotiation we did get a taxi to our home. Overall the journey was appalling and the staff were dismissive unhelpful and uncaring.",na
This is the worst airline I have ever experienced they have changed my trip 5 times before departure (of course without telling me about it) are impossible to get in touch with and refuse get me a hotel when they leave me in the middle of nowhere when the last leg of the trip is cancelled.,na
I flew RAM last December/January but I'm writing only now because I gave their customer service time to follow up on my complaint which never eventuated. We got to Marrakech via Casablanca from Milan but our luggage did not. It was boarded on the following day's flight (because the cargo was full). This meant waiting in line until midnight to fill out a lost luggage form with the airport authorities. No receipt/copy could be produced as the photocopier was outside the Marrakech airport terminal. This also meant I would have no proof of the incident. They gave us the wrong number to call and it was only thanks to our kind hotel manager that we were able to go back to the airport (paying our own fare) to retrieve our luggage. This some 16 hours after our plane had landed (did I forget to mention we had left Milan 3.5 hours late with no refreshments provided). When I got back to Milan I was instructed by the RAM office in Milan to send a fax (in the era of email correspondence) to their customer care office in Prague (RAM does not even fly to the Czech Republic). Which I did on January 19. After countless follow-up emails nothing. I strongly suggest they do away with the 'Royal'.,na
I lived abroad for 17 years and always used the Moroccan air lines to travel. But I finally decided not to use RAM anymore - bad service horrible staff expensive fares.,4/10
Marrakech-London. Cancelled but only after 3 hours waiting around and zero information. Ground staff for Air Maroc incompetent and in some cases rude. Onboard the flight a very tatty B737 food was rather poor. What was disgraceful was the complete disregard to safety standards by cabin crew. I thought the earlier reviews I had read were exaggerating but now know how awful this airline really is. Easyjet next time for me.,3/10
CMN-LHR Business Class. Check-in no wait and pre-assigned seat. Spacious lounge. A321 with very slighted faded appearance. Three rows of 2x2 comfortable seats but somewhat limited pitch. Newspapers magazines and champagne after boarding. Drinks and dinner inflight. Cheerful and efficient service. Announcements in Arabic French and English.,na
We arrived at Gatwick to find the plane supposedly cancelled - apparently nothing new for the Air Maroc flight to Marrakech to be cancelled - what is really meant was that there was to be a 2 hour delay. The service on the flight was extremely poor - my row did not get any food and when we requested it from the air stewards it eventually came with no apology. I waited 30 minutes for a glass of water to take a tablet. The way back to Heathrow was no better. We got to check in very early so we were not sat at the back of the plane - but when we were given our tickets we were at the back on the both our planes (Marrakech to Casablanca Casablanca to Heathrow) - in fact on the first flight we had seats on row 36 despite the plane being a 737-700 with about 26 seats. When we requested to be moved further forward we were told that row 38 on the second plane was at the front of the plane and that the seating configuration was reversed on this plane. After two attempts to request new seats (taking a total of over 30 minutes) we managed to get moved half way up the plane. We were amazed at the rudeness of staff on check in when we requested a seat change. When we got on the plane both planes were only about 50% full!,8/10
Dreadful service and communication from this airline. Returning from Marrakesh to Heathrow on with four children we along with 20 other passengers were held for 24 hours in transit at Casablanca. Apparently the airline had double booked the seats. However all our luggage flew with the original plane. No food or hotel was offered. No manager was available. Passengers were completely abandoned.,na
Terrible service do not fly with this airline. We were delayed for more than 7 hours in Marrakech and were told that there was no plane to take us by some staff and no pilot to fly it by other staff. We were never told why by the Royal Air Maroc staff although we asked repeatedly. UK systems showed our flight as having departed when we were still in the airport to those waiting for us. A further delay of 10 hours was threatened and only narrowly avoided by persistent negotiation with airline staff. The airline did provide food but tried everything they could to avoid it adding a huge amount to the stress. I was abandoned at 3:30am in Gatwick with no way of continuing my onward journey and nowhere to stay. Gatwick information were told by a Royal Air Maroc represeentative at 4 am that passengers should make their own way home. When we landed we were told they hoped we had enjoyed our flight!,na
Terrible. Worst experience ever. They are not to blame for the weather induced delays but they are to blame for the lack of communication with passengers and the uncooperative disposition of their staff. Due to comment restrictions I cannot elaborate on some of the problems I encountered. But this I can say they forgot to put my name in the passenger name list for the return flight and I had to buy another ticket with another airline. Never fly with this airline!,na
LGW to Marrakech. Flight delayed 3 hours no information given and no sign of any staff on hand to assist. Once airborne on an old and uncomfortable 737 things didn't improve. Grumpy staff and appalling food. Return flight on time but still an awful aircraft. Only 40 passengers but it took 90 mins to serve a cup of coffee the reason being that half the flight attendants had stretched out over 3 seats each at the back and gone to sleep! Not encouraging if there had been an emergency.,na
"Seems we were lucky to get to Marrakech from Gatwick on our booked flight with our luggage. On the way back flight changed to call in at Casablanca. Wrong check in queue on departure board. Check in 2 hr early still left luggage in Marrakech when we got to Edinburgh with BA from Heathrow 15 hours later. It arrived at our home 2 days later. Seat legroom awful. Poor safety checking of seat belts etc on passengers. No decaf coffee or green tea and no politeness when told so. Very poor information to passengers when delayed in Casablanca for 2 hours for ""air conditioning check"" and ""luggage does not match passengers"". Very late lunch had to use own reserve food. Assured we would get connecting flight even half an hour before arrival; but taking 40 min to get to standstill after delayed estimated landing time resulted in a disordered mutiny of passengers trying to get off and panicky staff. Missed connecting flight; no guidance as to how to reorganise for being 2.25 hours late. Don't use them.",1/10
London-Fes via Casablanca. Connecting flight delayed nearly 3 hours amidst much confusion and RAM intentionally left much of the baggage behind in Casablanca. We were later told that this is a routine practice on this sector due to the limited capacity of the ATR72 used. We had to queue for an hour at 1am to register a lost baggage claim. When our bags reached Fes over 24 hours later we had to return to the airport to collect them because of 'security'.,2/10
London Gatwick - Marrakech. The snow brought the worst out of Royal Air Maroc. Chaotic check in with passengers from the previous day trying to book onto flights. No information and rude check-in staff. Flight did eventually go 4 hours late. My biggest complaint was lack of communication about the delay and rude disinterested staff. Food was OK legroom was terrible and seat was very uncomfortable. Safety demonstration was lacklustre and was a mish-mash of 3 languages. Never again.,4/10
I bought a direct flight 2 months ago for travelling just before the Christmas evening from Ouarzazate to Paris (3hr 30mins flight) and RAM cancelled the flight - offering to travel on Christmas day with 2 stopovers from 7am to 2230 during almost 15 hours. I tried to find another flight but there is no other company in Ouarzazate!,na
Delayed for 6 hours on both JFK to Casablanca and then Casablanca to Istanbul. Ground manager hurled insults instead of explaining the delay at JFK. My luggage arrived 4 days after I arrived in Istanbul leaving me and my wife with a handbag only. I will not fly Royal Air Maroc again even if it's for free.,na
"Awful and unprofessional - canceled our flight and didn't even tell us. Didn't meet us at the airport nobody to tell us what to do where to go book us onto a new flight give us a hotel etc. Lisbon to Casablanca not one person from Royal Air Maroc was around to represent the company give advice or assist. We were given a phone number by the airport authority and RAM didn't answer the phone for 2 days! Thank god TAP finally forced us onto a new flight and got us home. In Morocco when things go wrong or never happen on time people always say ""this is Morocco"". We love Morocco and this is not a Moroccan thing it's business ethics and this behaviour is Royal Air Maroc.",na
Montreal-Casablanca-Tunis and return. Old and dirty Boeing 767-300ER but crew worked hard and food was way above average in quality and quantity. Delayed 6 hours in Casablanca received meal voucher but only because I asked. Full meal served both ways from CME to TUN.,na
Amsterdam to Ouarzazate via Casablanca. Check in smooth and fast. Choice of meal (chicken or fish) enough drinks (soft and hot). Friendly attendants. The domestic flight from Casablanca tot Ouarzazate was a short trip (40 mins). Waiting for your luggage at this little airport was very short - immigration paper work was a little bit longer.,7/10
Of the 6 flights (2 international and 4 domestic; Madrid-Marrakesh; Essaouira-Casablanca; Casablanca-Fez; Casablanca-Ouarzazate; Ouarzazate-Casablanca; Casablanca-Amsterdam ) only one was on time. The rest delayed for at least an hour. The longest delay was 12 hours for a flight which only took 30 minutes! The problem - there was simply no plane available to bring us to our destination although it was a normal scheduled flight. The only positive thing about the airline is that they put you in a good hotel to wait/spend the night. But I guess that is because they have a lot of experience with that - I will certainly not choice this airline again.,7/10

"This is the most unorganized air line I have ever flown. They lost both of our checked bags going to our destination. Try as they would they never managed to get those bags to us. At one point they told us our bags were being shipped UPS. I told them I called UPS and they had no record of any such shipment; I asked RAM to give me the confirmation number so I could call UPS back - RAM hung up on me. Then on the way back we checked in one bag and yes they lost that one too. For our boarding on the way back they called for general boarding and everyone hoarded around the door in one big general mass. So then they decided to let families on board first - it was chaos because everyone was already jammed together. People were trying to squeeze through babies being squashed children crying. One couple complained profusely that it doesn't make any sense to call for general boarding and then limit it to only families. The RAM attendant responded that it wasn't his job to ""organize you people"". Really? And if it isn't their job to organize boarding it really makes me wonder about other things. There were so many more signs of disorganization it is truly unbelievable.",7/10
My wife and I flew with this airline from London to Fez via Casablanca. The outward journey went without problem but the return was a different story. We left ample time for our connection but the Fez flight took off an hour and a half late. I talked to the cabin crew about our connection and asked them to radio ahead they said there would be no problem. When we got to Casablanca the flight had gone and there was nobody from Royal Air Maroc to meet us. We had to find their office ourselves which was tucked away in arrivals. The attendent said come back tomorrow and catch the flight then. We had a discussion and made them book us on a flight to Amsterdam and then KLM to London but got to London so late we had to stay there the night before catching our train to Manchester. We complained via eBookers who tried hard to contact Royal Air Maroc. We also wrote a letter of complaint but no replies leaving us £206 pounds out of pocket. Do not use this airline they are a shambles.,na
Have had an awful experience with this airline on 2 occasions. On my first trip between Heathrow to Tangier I was contacted by phone 4 days before the departure date to be told that there was no direct flight anymore and I had to transit via Casablanca (transit time 6 hours!). I was offered the option to cancel my flight against full refund however till today I have not received anything despite numerous e-mail and phone complaints. On another trip between Casablanca and Accra the plane was delayed for 5 hours at departure and 3 hours in the return journey (needless to mention the rudeness of the ground and cabin staff and low- service quality).,4/10
